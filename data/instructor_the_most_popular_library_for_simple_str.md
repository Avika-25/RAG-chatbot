As AI models like GPT become more powerful and flexible, developers are often faced with a challenge: how do we get structured outputs from large language models (LLMs)? Enter Instructor, a library designed to simplify structured data extraction from LLMs. In this blog post, we'll explore what makes Instructor so effective, break down the code, and understand how you can integrate it with models like OpenAI's GPT and Cohere's models.

Instructor makes it easy to prompt LLMs for structured outputs, such as JSON data. Instead of receiving unstructured text, you can request LLMs to provide responses in the format you need. This is especially useful for:

Instructor abstracts away complexity, enabling you to build robust applications faster. By specifying a schema for the output, you ensure your AI delivers exactly what you need.

First, let's install the necessary libraries. The notebook starts with a simple installation step:

Output:

This installs all necessary packages quietly (without verbose output).

Next, you need API keys for OpenAI and Cohere. The code fetches these from Google Colab's userdata storage:

1.OpenAI API Key:

2.Cohere API Key:

Now, let's import the required libraries:

Pydantic is a powerful data validation and parsing library in Python. It allows you to define schemas (structured models) for your data using Python classes. These schemas ensure that data conforms to the expected format and type, providing a reliable way to validate incoming data and prevent errors. Pydantic is particularly useful when you need to ensure consistency and correctness of data in applications.

Here's an example of a simple pydantic model:

If you provide incorrect data types, Pydantic will raise a validation error:

Output:

When combined with Instructor, Pydantic helps define the structure of the data you expect from an LLM. This means you can:

Instructor uses Pydantic models to guide the LLM in generating consistent, structured outputs, making your applications more reliable and easier to maintain.

Here's an example of how to define a structured output using pydantic and Instructor:

In this example:

This model tells the LLM to output responses matching this structure.

Instructor can gracefully handle errors when the model output doesn't match the expected structure. If the LLM returns an output that doesn't align with the defined pydantic model, Instructor raises a validation error.

This helps ensure your application can handle unexpected outputs gracefully.

The Instructor library is a powerful tool for extracting structured data from large language models like OpenAI's GPT and Cohere's models. By combining the flexibility of LLMs with the precision of pydantic schemas, Instructor allows you to build applications that require consistent, structured outputs with ease.

Whether you're building chatbots, automating data pipelines, or working on enterprise AI solutions, Instructor can help streamline your development process.
