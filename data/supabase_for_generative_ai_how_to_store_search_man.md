Be part of Gen AI Launch Pad 2025 and make your mark today.

In the era of artificial intelligence, efficient data storage, retrieval, and management are crucial for building powerful GenAI applications. Supabase, an open-source backend-as-a-service (BaaS), provides scalable real-time databases, authentication, and edge functions, making it an excellent choice for GenAI developers.

In this guide, weâ€™ll explore how to leverage Supabase for tasks like embedding storage, similarity search, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Youâ€™ll learn how to:

By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of integrating Supabase with OpenAI and LangChain to build intelligent applications.

To begin, install the necessary Python libraries for interacting with Supabase and handling AI embeddings.
