Gen AI Launch Pad 2025 is your moment to shine.

In the age of AI-driven automation, extracting, processing, and understanding data from diverse document formats is crucial. ExtractThinker is an open-source Document Intelligence framework that integrates seamlessly with Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline document processing. Whether you need to extract structured information from PDFs, images, or spreadsheets, ExtractThinker offers a powerful ORM-style interface, advanced data extraction capabilities, and flexible classification tools.

In this guide, we will walk you through the installation, setup, and use of ExtractThinker, providing a deep dive into its features and real-world applications. By the end, you'll have a clear understanding of how to automate document intelligence tasks with LLMs.

ExtractThinker is designed to handle large-scale document processing efficiently. Some of its standout features include:

Now, let’s get started with installing and setting up ExtractThinker.

To begin, install ExtractThinker along with necessary dependencies:

To use ExtractThinker with OpenAI’s GPT models, set up your API key in your environment:

This step ensures secure authentication while interacting with LLMs for document processing.

ExtractThinker provides various document loaders. Here, we’ll use DocumentLoaderPyPdf to handle PDF files.

An extractor acts as a bridge between the document loader and the LLM, facilitating data extraction.

ExtractThinker uses Pydantic-based contracts to define the structure of extracted data. Let’s create a contract for processing invoices:

This contract ensures that only the specified fields are extracted from the document.

For demonstration, let’s download a sample invoice PDF and extract its data:

Now, extract data based on the contract:

The extracted data provides structured information that can be used in downstream applications like financial analysis or record-keeping.

To enhance user experience, ExtractThinker allows file uploads via a widget interface in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

This code allows users to either upload a PDF file or provide a file path manually for processing.

ExtractThinker also supports document classification, allowing automated categorization of documents.

ExtractThinker offers a robust and flexible framework for document processing, enabling seamless integration with LLMs for data extraction and classification. By defining structured contracts, utilizing OCR tools, and integrating intelligent classification, businesses can automate document intelligence workflows efficiently.
