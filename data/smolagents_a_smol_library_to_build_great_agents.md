smolagents is a lightweight library for constructing and running agents with just a few lines of code. It emphasizes simplicity, security, and versatility by providing:

In this blog, we will:

Before diving into examples, we start by installing the required libraries and configuring API keys. Here's the setup process:

No visual output is expected from this block. Ensure dependencies are installed and keys are correctly configured.

This setup is critical for leveraging external APIs and tools in smolagents, enabling secure and seamless communication with LLMs.

A CodeAgent executes Python code as part of its reasoning process. Below is an example using a DuckDuckGo search tool and a Hugging Face model.

CodeAgents are ideal for automating tasks that require computation or integration with external tools, such as data analysis or web scraping.

You can extend smolagents by creating custom tools. Below is an example of a tool to fetch the most downloaded model for a given task on the Hugging Face Hub.

The name of the most downloaded model for the specified task.

Custom tools allow you to extend smolagents for domain-specific tasks, such as retrieving information from APIs or databases.

A simple Gradio interface can be created for the agent, enabling an interactive user experience.

A Gradio interface with an input box for user queries and an output area for agent responses.

Use Gradio to create accessible demos or deploy interactive tools for end-users.

Combine retrieval techniques with language models for information-heavy tasks. Below is an example using a custom retriever tool.

Relevant documents from the Transformers documentation, highlighting differences between the forward and backward passes.

RAG is useful for tasks requiring precise answers from large knowledge bases, such as technical documentation or academic research.

The smolagents library simplifies the creation of intelligent agents by combining modularity with the power of LLMs. From basic computation to complex retrieval tasks, smolagents empowers developers to integrate AI into various applications effortlessly.
