Are you waiting for change, or will you create it?

The future is calling—answer it with Gen AI Launch Pad 2025.

AI agents are revolutionizing automation, task execution, and decision-making processes. AgentLite is an open-source framework designed to streamline the development of intelligent, task-oriented AI agents using large language models (LLMs). Whether you want to build a simple single-agent system or a sophisticated multi-agent architecture, AgentLite provides an easy-to-use and highly customizable solution.

In this guide, we will:

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll be equipped to create your own custom AI agents for real-world applications!

Before we start coding, install the required dependencies:

We also need to set up an OpenAI API Key for accessing the language model:

Why Use AgentLite? AgentLite simplifies the process of developing AI agents that interact with LLMs. By integrating with frameworks like LangChain, it provides a structured approach to agent design.

To understand AgentLite’s core workflow, let’s create a simple agent that responds with “Hello World!” when given any instruction.

Next, let’s take things further by building an AI agent that plays chess!

We first define an action that allows the agent to make a move on a chessboard.

(This represents the initial chessboard state.)

Now, we define an AI-powered chess player that interacts with the board.

In this guide, we explored AgentLite, built a Hello World agent, and created an AI-powered chess player capable of interacting with a chessboard. AI agents like these can be applied to gaming, automation, and task delegation in various industries.
