With the rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various applications, ensuring the quality of their responses is essential. Judges Library is a lightweight Python package designed to evaluate AI-generated responses based on correctness, clarity, and bias. Whether you're fine-tuning an LLM or assessing its reliability, this library provides LLM-as-a-Judge tools to automate and enhance response evaluation.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

Before using Judges Library, install the necessary dependencies:

To use LLM-based evaluators, you need to configure API keys. For instance, in Google Colab:

To test Judges Library, we first generate an AI response using OpenAI's GPT models. Below is a sample story-based question:

The model should respond with "I don't know" since the rabbit's name is not mentioned. Now, let's evaluate this response.

Classifier Judges provide boolean evaluations (True/False, Good/Bad) based on predefined correctness criteria. Below, we use PollMultihopCorrectness to evaluate if the generated output matches expectations.

A jury system combines multiple evaluators for a more balanced judgment. Here, we use PollMultihopCorrectness and RAFTCorrectness to assess an LLM response.

AutoJudge allows you to create custom AI evaluators based on labeled datasets. Below, we initialize AutoJudge with a dataset containing labeled AI responses.

Now, let’s evaluate a new AI-generated response:

Judges Library is a powerful framework for evaluating LLM-generated responses with various judging mechanisms, including classifier judges, jury systems, and AutoJudge. It provides a structured way to assess AI outputs based on correctness, clarity, and helpfulness, ensuring higher reliability and reduced bias in AI applications.
