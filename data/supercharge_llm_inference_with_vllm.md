Large Language Models (LLMs) are at the forefront of AI-driven applications, but running them efficiently remains a challenge due to their high computational and memory requirements. vLLM is a powerful, optimized inference engine designed to enhance the speed and efficiency of LLM execution. This blog provides a comprehensive guide to using vLLM, covering installation, model loading, text generation, batch processing, embeddings, and text classification.

By the end of this article, you will:

Before using vLLM, install the library with the following command:

This command installs the necessary dependencies to start working with vLLM.

To begin, load an LLM using vLLM. Here’s how you can load OPT-125M from Facebook’s model collection:

This initializes an instance of the LLM, making it ready for inference.

Sampling parameters control the randomness and diversity of text generation. Here’s how you can configure them:

These settings influence the model’s output diversity and length.

Now that the model is loaded and configured, let’s generate text from different prompts:

This demonstrates how vLLM efficiently generates coherent and contextually relevant text.

vLLM supports batch processing, enabling multiple prompts to be processed in parallel, improving efficiency.

This output indicates efficient batch processing, with high token throughput.

Embeddings convert text into numerical vectors, useful for NLP tasks like similarity comparison and clustering.

Text classification categorizes input text into predefined classes.

vLLM is a powerful tool for fast and efficient LLM inference. Key takeaways:
