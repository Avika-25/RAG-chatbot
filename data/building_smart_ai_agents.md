The ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern is revolutionising how we build AI agents by combining reasoning with action-taking capabilities. In this article, we'll explore how to implement ReAct patterns in Python, comparing traditional approaches with modern frameworks like LangGraph. We'll build a practical example that helps users find and compare restaurant ratings — a task that showcases the power of structured reasoning in AI applications.

The ReAct pattern follows a simple yet powerful loop:

Let's implement a restaurant rating comparison system using the traditional ReAct pattern:

Output:

This RestaurantAgent class forms the foundation of our implementation. Let's understand its key components:

The action system is implemented through:

The main query function implements the ReAct loop:

Now, let's implement the same functionality using LangGraph, which provides a more structured and maintainable approach:

Output:

The node system in LangGraph offers several advantages:

The graph construction showcases LangGraph's power:

The ReAct pattern, whether implemented traditionally or with LangGraph, is particularly useful for:

While the traditional ReAct pattern implementation offers simplicity and ease of understanding, LangGraph provides a more robust and scalable solution for production environments. The choice between the two approaches depends on your specific needs:

Choose the traditional approach for:

Choose LangGraph for:

Both approaches demonstrate the power of combining reasoning with action in AI agents, leading to more capable and reliable automated systems.

1. Thought: The agent reasons about the current state and what needs to be done
2. Action: The agent takes a specific action based on its reasoning
3. Observation: The agent receives feedback from the action
4. Repeat: The cycle continues until reaching a final answer

1. State Management: The agent maintains its state through the messages list, which keeps track of the entire conversation history. This is crucial for maintaining context throughout the interaction.
2. System Prompt: The system parameter allows us to define the agent's behavior and available actions. This is where we set up the ReAct pattern's structure of Thought, Action, and Observation.

1. Action Functions: Each action (like get_restaurant_rating) is a standalone function that performs a specific task. In a real-world application, these functions might query APIs or databases.
2. Action Registry: The known_actions dictionary serves as a registry of available actions, making it easy to add or modify capabilities.

1. Pattern Matching: Uses regular expressions to identify when the agent wants to take an action
2. Action Execution: Extracts the action name and input, executes the action, and provides the result as an observation
3. Loop Control: Continues until either reaching the maximum turns or finding no more actions to take

1. Typed State: Using TypedDict provides type safety and clear documentation of the state structure
2. Explicit State Components: Each piece of information has a designated place in the state
3. Message History: Maintains a sequence of messages for context, similar to the traditional approach but with better structure

1. Functional Approach: Each node is a pure function that takes a state and returns a modified state
2. Clear Responsibilities: Nodes have single responsibilities — either making decisions (agent_node) or performing actions (get_restaurant_rating_node)
3. Immutable State Updates: The state is updated in a controlled manner, making the system more predictable

1. Explicit Flow: The graph structure makes the flow of control explicit and visual
2. Conditional Routing: Using add_conditional_edges allows for complex decision-making about the next step
3. Compilation: The compile() step optimizes the graph for execution

1. Structured Flow: LangGraph provides a more explicit structure through its graph-based approach, making the flow of logic clearer and more maintainable.
2. State Management: LangGraph's typed state management helps catch errors early and makes the code more robust.
3. Modularity: The graph-based approach makes it easier to add new capabilities or modify existing ones without changing the core logic.
4. Visualization: LangGraph allows for easy visualization of the agent's decision-making process, which is valuable for debugging and explanation.
