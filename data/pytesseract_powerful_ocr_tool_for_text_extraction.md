Will you watch from the sidelines as innovation unfolds, or will you be in the driver’s seat?

Gen AI Launch Pad 2025 is waiting.

In today’s digital age, extracting text from images, scanned documents, or handwritten notes has become a critical task for many applications. Whether you're automating document processing, digitizing recipes, or analyzing PDFs, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is the technology that makes it all possible. Among the many OCR tools available, PyTesseract stands out as a powerful and versatile Python wrapper for Tesseract OCR. In this blog, we’ll dive deep into how you can use PyTesseract to extract text from images, preprocess images for better accuracy, and even integrate it with AI tools like Google’s Gemini for advanced text processing.

PyTesseract is an open-source Python library that acts as a wrapper for Tesseract OCR, one of the most accurate and widely used OCR engines. It allows you to extract text from images, scanned documents, and even handwritten notes with ease. PyTesseract supports over 100 languages and can handle a variety of image formats, including PNG, JPG, TIFF, and more.

Before we dive into the code, let’s set up PyTesseract on your system. Here’s what you need to install:

To get started, import the necessary Python libraries:

Before extracting text, you need an image to work with. Here’s a function to download an image from a URL:

Example Usage:

Once you have an image, you can use PyTesseract to extract text from it. Here’s how:

Example Usage:

OCR accuracy can be significantly improved by preprocessing the image. Common techniques include converting the image to grayscale, sharpening, and increasing contrast.

Example Usage:

PyTesseract can also extract text from PDFs by first converting the PDF pages into images.

Once you’ve extracted text, you can use Google’s Gemini to summarize or translate it.

If you’re working in a Jupyter notebook or Google Colab, you can display images using the following code:

PyTesseract is a powerful and versatile tool for text extraction from images and documents. By combining it with image preprocessing techniques and AI tools like Google’s Gemini, you can unlock even more advanced capabilities, such as summarization and translation. Whether you’re automating document processing, digitizing handwritten notes, or analyzing PDFs, PyTesseract is an essential tool in your Python toolkit.

Now that you’ve learned how to use PyTesseract, why not try it out on your own images or documents? Experiment with different preprocessing techniques and see how they affect OCR accuracy. And if you’re feeling adventurous, integrate it with other AI tools to create even more powerful workflows.
