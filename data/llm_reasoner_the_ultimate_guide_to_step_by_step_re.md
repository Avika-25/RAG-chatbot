Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but often function as black boxes, making it difficult to understand how they arrive at their conclusions. LLM-Reasoner is an open-source library that introduces step-by-step reasoning, helping developers visualize and interpret LLM outputs more effectively. In this tutorial, we’ll explore how to install, configure, and use LLM-Reasoner to make AI more transparent and explainable.

Before using LLM-Reasoner, you need to install it using pip:

This will download and install the necessary dependencies, making the library ready for use.

LLM-Reasoner supports multiple LLM providers, such as OpenAI and Google. To authenticate, you need to set up API keys:

Ensure that you replace userdata.get('OPENAI_API_KEY') with your actual API key retrieval method if you are not using Google Colab.

To see the list of supported models, run:

Expected output:

To generate structured reasoning for a query, use the following command:

The model will break down its reasoning process into multiple steps, each with a confidence score and detailed explanation.

For more control, use LLM-Reasoner within Python:

This script runs LLM-Reasoner in an asynchronous loop, displaying reasoning steps with confidence levels.

For advanced users, LLM-Reasoner provides customizable settings:

For a more interactive experience, run the Streamlit UI:

After execution, you'll get a URL (e.g., https://your-url.loca.lt) where you can access the interface.

LLM-Reasoner is a powerful tool for enhancing AI transparency by breaking down complex reasoning processes. By using structured steps, real-time tracking, and confidence metrics, developers can better understand and trust AI decisions. Whether you're working with APIs, Python scripts, or an interactive UI, LLM-Reasoner provides a flexible and intuitive solution for step-by-step LLM explanations.
