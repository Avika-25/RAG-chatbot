Gen AI Launch Pad 2025 is your moment to shine.

Speech AI has seen rapid advancements, and NVIDIA NeMo stands at the forefront of this evolution. NeMo provides a modular and scalable approach to building speech-related AI applications, including automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), and speech classification. This guide will walk you through NeMo’s key features, code implementation, and real-world applications.

Before diving into the code, ensure you have NVIDIA NeMo installed. If not, install it using the following command:

To start, we need to import the essential libraries:

Expected Output: The model will be downloaded and initialized, ready for inference.

Expected Output:

To fine-tune the model, we need to set up training parameters:

To deploy a trained model, we can save and export it:

To load the model later:

NVIDIA NeMo provides a powerful toolkit for developing Speech AI applications. Whether you’re working on ASR, TTS, or speech classification, NeMo simplifies development with pretrained models and modular design. Try implementing NeMo in your projects today!
