Why build a general-purpose agent?

Because it’s an excellent tool to prototype your use cases and lays the groundwork for designing your own custom agentic architecture.

Before we dive in, let’s quickly introduce LLM agents. Feel free to skip ahead.

An LLM agent is a program whose execution logic is controlled by its underlying model.

What sets an LLM agent apart from approaches like few-shot prompting or fixed workflows is its ability to define and adapt the steps required to execute a user’s query. Given access to a set of tools (like code execution or web search), the agent can decide which tool to use, how to use it, and iterate on results based on the output. This adaptability enables the system to handle diverse use cases with minimal configuration.

Agentic architectures exist on a spectrum, ranging from the reliability of fixed workflows to the flexibility of autonomous agents. For instance, a fixed flow like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can be enhanced with a self-reflection loop, enabling the program to iterate when the initial response falls short. Alternatively, a ReAct agent can be equipped with fixed flows as tools, offering a flexible yet structured approach. The choice of architecture ultimately depends on the use case and the desired trade-off between reliability and flexibility.

Choosing the right model is critical to achieving your desired performance. There are several factors to consider, like licensing, cost, and language support. The most important consideration for building an LLM agent is the model’s performance on key tasks like coding, tool calling, and reasoning. Benchmarks to evaluate include:

Another crucial factor is the model’s context window. Agentic workflows can eat up a lot of tokens — sometimes 100K or more — a larger context window is really helpful.

Models to Consider (at the time of writing)

In general, larger models tend to offer better performance, but smaller models that can run locally are still a solid option. With smaller models, you’ll be limited to simpler use cases and might only be able to connect your agent to one or two basic tools.

The main difference between a simple LLM and an agent comes down to the system prompt.

The system prompt, in the context of an LLM, is a set of instructions and contextual information provided to the model before it engages with user queries.

The agentic behavior expected of the LLM can be codified within the system prompt.

Here are some common agentic patterns, which can be customized to fit your needs:

The last two patterns — ReAct and Plan-then-Execute — are often the best starting point for building a general-purpose single agent.

To implement these behaviors effectively, you’ll need to do some prompt engineering. You might also want to use a structured generation technique. This basically means shaping the LLM’s output to match a specific format or schema, so the agent’s responses stay consistent with the communication style you’re aiming for.

Example: Below is a system prompt excerpt for a ReAct style agent from the Bee Agent Framework.

We tend to take for granted that LLMs come with a bunch of features right out of the box. Some of these are great, but others might not be exactly what you need. To get the performance you’re after, it’s important to spell out all the features you want — and don’t want — in the system prompt.

This could include instructions like:

Example: Below is a snippet of the instructions section from the Bee Agent Framework.

Tools are what give your agents their superpowers. With a narrow set of well-defined tools, you can achieve broad functionality. Key tools to include are code execution, web search, file reading, and data analysis.

For each tool, you’ll need to define the following and include it as part of the system prompt:

Example: Below is an excerpt of an Arxiv tool implementation from Langchain Community. This implementation requires an ArxivAPIWrapper implementation.

In certain cases, you’ll need to optimize tools to get the performance you’re looking for. This might involve tweaking the tool name or description with some prompt engineering, setting up advanced configurations to handle common errors, or filtering the tool’s output.

LLMs are limited by their context window — the number of tokens they can “remember” at a time. This memory can fill up fast with things like past interactions in multi-turn conversations, lengthy tool outputs, or extra context the agent is grounded on. That’s why having a solid memory handling strategy is crucial.

Memory, in the context of an agent, refers to the system’s capability to store, recall, and utilize information from past interactions. This enables the agent to maintain context over time, improve its responses based on previous exchanges, and provide a more personalized experience.

Common Memory Handling Strategies:

Additionally, you can also have an LLM detect key moments to store in long-term memory. This allows the agent to “remember” important facts about the user, making the experience even more personalized.

The five steps we’ve covered so far lay the foundation for setting up an agent. But what happens if we run a user query through our LLM at this stage?

Here’s an example of what that might look like:

At this point, the agent produces raw text output. So how do we get it to actually execute the next step? That’s where parsing and orchestration come in.

A parser is a function that converts raw data into a format your application can understand and work with (like an object with properties)

For the agent we’re building, the parser needs to recognize the communication structure we defined in Step 2 and return a structured output, like JSON. This makes it easier for the application to process and execute the agent’s next steps.

Note: some model providers like OpenAI, can return parsable outputs by default. For other models, especially open-source ones, this would need to be configured.

The final step is setting up the orchestration logic. This determines what happens after the LLM outputs a result. Depending on the output, you’ll either:

If a tool call is triggered, the tool’s output is sent back to the LLM (as part of its working memory). The LLM would then determine what to do with this new information: either perform another tool call or return an answer to the user.

Here’s an example of how this orchestration logic might look in code:

And voilà! You now have a system capable of handling a wide variety of use cases — from competitive analysis and advanced research to automating complex workflows.

While this generation of LLMs is incredibly powerful, they have a key limitation: they struggle with information overload. Too much context or too many tools can overwhelm the model, leading to performance issues. A general-purpose single agent will eventually hit this ceiling, especially since agents are notoriously token-hungry.

For certain use cases, a multi-agent setup might make more sense. By dividing responsibilities across multiple agents, you can avoid overloading the context of a single LLM agent and improve overall efficiency.

That said, a general-purpose single-agent setup is a fantastic starting point for prototyping. It can help you quickly test your use case and identify where things start to break down. Through this process, you can:

Starting with a single agent gives you valuable insights to refine your approach as you scale to more complex systems.

Building a general-purpose LLM agent provides a solid foundation for developing custom AI solutions tailored to specific use cases. By carefully selecting the right LLM, defining control logic, structuring communication, and integrating optimized tools, you can create an adaptable and efficient agent. The balance between flexibility and reliability depends on your architecture choices, such as using ReAct or Plan-then-Execute patterns. Additionally, memory handling and tool optimization play crucial roles in enhancing the agent's performance. With continuous refinements and prompt engineering, you can build an LLM agent capable of handling diverse tasks with minimal human intervention.
