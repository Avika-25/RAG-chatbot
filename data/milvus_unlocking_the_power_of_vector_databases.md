What’s the one problem AI hasn’t solved yet?

Join Gen AI Launch Pad 2024 and turn groundbreaking challenges into your greatest achievements. The future of AI is waiting for you to lead.

In the age of AI and big data, vector databases have become indispensable for applications like recommendation systems, image and text retrieval, and more. This blog dives into Milvus, a leading open-source vector database designed to handle massive-scale vector data efficiently. By the end of this post, you will understand the fundamentals of Milvus, how to set it up, and use its powerful features to build your own vector-based applications.

The pymilvus library provides a Python interface to interact with the Milvus database. This command installs version 2.0.0, which is compatible with the examples provided in this blog. The ! is used to execute the command in a Jupyter Notebook or similar interactive environment.

The terminal or notebook output will display logs confirming the installation:

If errors occur, ensure your environment has network access and pip is updated.

Installing pymilvus is essential for developing Python applications that interact with Milvus. This step lays the groundwork for building vector-based AI systems.

This snippet establishes a connection to the Milvus server. It uses the default alias "default" to refer to this connection in subsequent operations. The host and port parameters specify the server location and the port it is listening on (default is 19530).

No explicit output is shown if the connection is successful. If the server is not reachable, an error message similar to this will appear:

This step is foundational for using Milvus. Without a connection, no operations (like inserting or searching data) can be performed.

In this block, we define the schema for a Milvus collection and create the collection. A collection is analogous to a table in relational databases.

Upon successful creation, no direct output is shown. Errors may occur if the collection name is already in use or the schema is invalid:

Collections organize data in Milvus. Use them to store embeddings for applications like image retrieval, text similarity, or recommendation systems.

Building a Vector Database for Scalable Similarity Search

This block demonstrates how to generate and insert data into the collection:

This indicates that 100 records have been successfully inserted into the collection.

Inserting data is critical for applications that rely on vector search, such as retrieving similar images or finding related documents.

Using the Milvus Vector Database for Real-Time Query

This code performs a similarity search in the collection:

A list of search results showing IDs and distances:

Vector search is used in systems like facial recognition, recommendation engines, and document retrieval.

Milvus simplifies the implementation of vector search, enabling developers to build scalable, high-performance AI applications. With its intuitive Python SDK, you can create, manage, and query collections effortlessly.

* Why Version 2.0.0? Ensures compatibility with the Milvus server version used in this tutorial.
* Environment Requirements: Python 3.7 or later is recommended.

* connections.connect: Links the application to the Milvus server.
* Localhost: Assumes Milvus is running locally. Replace with the actual IP or domain if Milvus is deployed remotely.
* Alias: Enables multiple connections to different Milvus instances.

* FieldSchema: Defines attributes of a field.
* name: Field name (e.g., "id" or "embedding").
* dtype: Data type (e.g., INT64 for IDs, FLOAT_VECTOR for embeddings).
* is_primary: Marks the field as the primary key.
* dim: Specifies the dimensionality for vector fields.
* CollectionSchema: Groups fields into a single schema.

* Collection: Instantiates a new collection with the defined schema.

* A list of unique integers from 0 to 99 is created.

* Random 128-dimensional vectors are generated using Python’s random module.

* The insert method adds the IDs and embeddings to the collection.

* Data format must match the collection schema.
* Ensure the number of IDs matches the number of embeddings.

* load: Brings the collection data into memory for faster querying.

* metric_type: Specifies the distance metric (e.g., L2 for Euclidean distance).
* nprobe: Number of partitions to search for approximate nearest neighbors.

* A random 128-dimensional vector is generated and used as the query.
* search: Finds the top 5 vectors closest to the query vector.

* Results are sorted by similarity (smallest distance for L2 metric).
* Adjusting nprobe can balance speed and accuracy.

* Milvus is optimized for vector search at scale.
* Collections and schemas form the foundation of data organization.
* The Python SDK makes integration straightforward.
