RAGatouille is a Python library designed to simplify the integration and training of state-of-the-art late-interaction retrieval methods, particularly ColBERT, within Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. It provides a modular and user-friendly interface, enabling developers to enhance their generative AI models with efficient document retrieval and indexing. This guide will explore its features, usage, and practical applications in document retrieval.

RAGatouille provides tools to train and fine-tune ColBERT models, allowing for customized retrieval tailored to specific datasets.

Supports embedding and indexing of documents, enabling efficient retrieval operations for large text datasets.

Enables retrieval of relevant documents based on queries, integrating smoothly with generative models to improve the relevance of responses.

Install RAGatouille using pip:

Before indexing, let’s retrieve text from Wikipedia using an API request.

Expected Output:

Let’s query the index for relevant information:

Expected Output:

You can measure the retrieval speed:

Expected Output:

Query multiple questions at once:

Expected Output:

If you have a saved index, you can load it directly:

For more refined search results, integrate Sentence Transformers with Voyager Index:

RAGatouille provides a powerful retrieval system that enhances RAG-based pipelines, making AI-driven search and generation more relevant and accurate. Whether you're indexing Wikipedia pages or creating a domain-specific search engine, RAGatouille streamlines the process with ColBERT-powered retrieval.
