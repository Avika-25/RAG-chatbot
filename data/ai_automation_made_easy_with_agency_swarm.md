The future is calling—answer it with Gen AI Launch Pad 2025.

Automation has become a game-changer in modern workflows, allowing businesses to optimize processes and enhance efficiency. Enter Agency Swarm, an advanced AI framework that enables multiple AI agents to work together just like a human team. With features like modular agent roles, intelligent communication, and customizable workflows, Agency Swarm is transforming automation.

This guide walks you through setting up and using Agency Swarm, helping you harness its full potential for task automation and data collection.

To start using Agency Swarm, follow these steps:

Use the following command to install the necessary libraries:

Set up OpenAI API keys for AI-powered automation:

The CEO Agent oversees operations and ensures seamless task execution:

A Test Agent verifies system responses:

Define thread management to keep track of ongoing conversations:

Define settings management:

Integrate multiple agents and set up an asynchronous communication model:

⚠ Note: 'threading' mode is deprecated. Use send_message_tool_class = SendMessageAsyncThreading for async communication.

The Report Manager supervises web data collection:

Configure Selenium for web browsing automation:

Agency Swarm is a powerful AI automation framework that simplifies complex workflows with modular agents and intelligent coordination. Whether you're managing projects, collecting data, or automating repetitive tasks, Agency Swarm provides scalability, efficiency, and adaptability.
