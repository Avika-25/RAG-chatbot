# Master AI Agents: Code Along Tutorial (LangChain & Crew AI)

## Workshop Recording:

## Deep Dive into AI Agents

## Practical Demonstrations

## Resources and Community

### Why AI Agents Matter

### Understanding AI Agent Architecture

### 1. Internet Search Agent (LangChain Implementation)

### 2. Multi-Agent Collaboration System (Crew AI)

### 3. Google's Gemini Advanced Deep Research Agent

The session bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementation, showing how AI agents can autonomously perform complex tasks through tool use and multi-agent collaboration.

Traditional LLMs like ChatGPT, while powerful, operate as passive instruction-following systems. This means users must guide them step-by-step through tasks, limiting their practical utility in real-world applications. AI agents overcome these limitations by introducing autonomous decision-making and tool usage capabilities.

Key limitations of traditional LLMs that agents address:

AI agents fundamentally transform how we interact with AI systems by introducing:

This demonstration showed how to create an agent that can access real-time information through web searches, effectively overcoming the knowledge cutoff limitation of traditional LLMs.

The agent demonstrated:

One of the workshop's highlights was the creation of a collaborative system where multiple AI agents work together to create a functioning application.

The system featured:

The agents successfully collaborated to create a working Ping Pong game, demonstrating how complex tasks can be broken down and handled by specialized agents.

As a bonus, participants got a glimpse of Google's powerful deep research capabilities:
