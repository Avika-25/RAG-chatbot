What is TaskGen?

TaskGen is designed for streamlined and efficient task automation. It leverages:

TaskGen is particularly useful in industries such as:

Let's get started by setting up the required libraries and configurations.

To use TaskGen, you need to install the necessary libraries. You can do this via pip:

If you're working in a virtual environment, make sure to activate it before installing the libraries.

You'll need your OpenAI API key to use LLM models within TaskGen. Here's how to configure it:

If you're not using Google Colab, you can manually set your API key like this:

You can define a custom LLM function to integrate OpenAI's models with TaskGen. Here's a sample configuration:

This function sends prompts to OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model and returns the model's response.

You can customize this function to use other models like GPT-3.5 or GPT-4.

TaskGen allows you to create specialized agents. Let's build a Psychology Counsellor Agent that understands and responds to user emotions.

Here, the agent is defined with a specific role and a description of its purpose.

To maintain context, use a ConversationWrapper with persistent memory:

Now, create a loop for user interaction:

This loop allows continuous interaction until the user decides to quit.

StrictJSON ensures the outputs from the LLM are always structured and predictable. This is particularly useful for:

CoT reasoning allows the agent to break down complex problems into logical steps. This improves accuracy and clarity, especially in tasks like:

Shared variables enable agents to pass information between tasks. This is useful in multi-step workflows where context needs to be maintained.

RAG allows the agent to retrieve external information and incorporate it into responses. This is particularly powerful for tasks that require up-to-date knowledge.

Async capabilities let you run multiple tasks concurrently, improving efficiency in:

You can fine-tune the LLM parameters to suit your needs. For example:

TaskGen offers a powerful framework for building task-based agents that can manage complex workflows efficiently. With features like StrictJSON outputs, shared variables, and async capabilities, TaskGen is ideal for automation projects requiring precise and reliable task management.
