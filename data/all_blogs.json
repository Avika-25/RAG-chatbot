    "content": "## Resources and Community\n\n### Memory consumption increases based on the total number of tokens needed for your prompt. The more tokens your prompt requires, the more memory is used, in addition to the memory needed to load the model itself.\n\n### How It Compares to Other Models\n\n### How to Access Gemma 3\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\n### Reference\n\n#### What is Gemma 3?\n\nDo you want to be a bystander in the world of tomorrow, or its creator?\n\nAct now—Gen AI Launch Pad 2025 is your gateway to innovation.\n\nGoogle released a brand new model called Gemma 3 with 27 billion parameters. Gemma is a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models. Gemma 3 is designed for developers building AI apps that can run anywhere from phones to workstations with support for over 35 languages and the ability to handle text, images, and short videos.\n\nAccording to the company's blog post, it's the \"world's best single-accelerator model,\" outpacing Meta's Llama, DeepSeek, and OpenAI's o1-preview and o3-mini-high on a single GPU host. That's impressive for a model built to stay lean.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Gemma 3.\n\nUnlike Google's proprietary Gemini models, which power their consumer-facing tools, Gemma 3 is open-source. It means it's accessible and available for use to anyone. It comes in four sizes: 1 billion, 4 billion, 12 billion, and 27 billion parameters.\n\nThe new model introduces several key features:\n\nThe models are now available for download on HuggingFace.\n\nIf you're planning to run it on your local machine, here are the approximate GPU or TPU memory requirements for running inferences with each size of the Gemma 3 model versions.\n\nGoogle describes it as their most advanced open model to date. \"These are our most advanced, portable and responsibly developed open models yet,\" the company said in its official blog post.\n\nThe original Gemma launched a year ago and has since racked up over 100 million downloads. Google says the community has created 60,000 variants, forming what they call the \"Gemmaverse.\"\n\nYou can learn more about the technical details of Gemma 3 here.\n\nIn blind, side-by-side evaluations conducted by human raters (Chiang et al., 2024), Gemma 3 demonstrated impressive performance against competing models. Using the Elo rating system (a widely recognized approach for assessing relative performance) Gemma-3–27B-IT received preliminary ratings that place it ahead of notable competitors, including Meta's Llama, DeepSeek, and OpenAI's o1-preview.\n\nThis positions Gemma 3 as a highly competitive option in the rapidly evolving landscape of open-source multimodal AI models. Here's a simpler graph to see how Gemma 3 compares to other models.\n\nGemma 3 were also evaluated across zero-shot benchmarks comparing various abilities against previous iterations like Gemma 2, as well as Gemini 1.5 and Gemini 2.0.\n\nHow Gemma 3 stacks up against Gemma 2, as well as Gemini 1.5 and Gemini 2.0\n\nThese evaluations indicate substantial improvements in capabilities, showcasing Gemma 3's enhanced ability to generalize and effectively handle diverse tasks without prior specific training.\n\nIf you just want to try it out, Google AI Studio lets you run it right in your browser — no setup needed. Head over to aistudio.google.com and set the model to \"Gemma 3 27B\".\n\nFor developers, you can grab an API key from AI Studio and integrate it using the Google GenAI SDK. Here's a sample Python usage in Vertex AI API.\n\nIf you need more control, Gemma 3 is available on Hugging Face, Kaggle, and Ollama, with all four sizes, plus ShieldGemma 2. Fine-tuning is supported out of the box, and you can run it on Google Colab or your own GPU.\n\nWhen it comes to deployment, there are plenty of options. You can scale with Vertex AI, launch quickly with Cloud Run and Ollama, or optimize performance with NVIDIA's API Catalog. The model is tuned for NVIDIA GPUs, Google Cloud TPUs, and AMD GPUs via ROCm, with CPU support through Gemma.cpp.\n\nAcademic researchers get a nice bonus — Google is offering $10,000 in Cloud credits through the Gemma 3 Academic Program. Applications opened today and will run for four weeks.\n\nTake note of the eligibility:\n\nOnly individuals (faculty members, researchers or equivalent) affiliated with a valid academic institution, or academic research organization can apply. Please note that credits will be granted at Google's discretion.\n\nGemma 3's performance is seriously impressive, especially considering its size. The fact that a 27B model can keep up with or even outperform much larger models says a lot about how far AI efficiency has come. It raises an interesting question — do we really need massive models for most tasks, or are we just scaling up unnecessarily?\n\nThe 128K token context is a huge improvement for its size, but the real game-changers are its multimodal capabilities and optimized inference speed. That said, I don't have many real-world use cases in mind that would take full advantage of all those tokens. Still, having the option is always a plus.\n\nI haven't done extensive testing yet, but from what I've seen so far, the initial reaction from the AI community is overwhelmingly positive. I'll be experimenting more with Gemma 3 on Ollama soon, and I'm especially curious to see how well the multimodal features perform.\n\nIf you're interested in AI development, I'd say it's definitely worth checking out. Whether you're testing it in Google AI Studio, fine-tuning it on Hugging Face, or deploying it through Vertex AI, there are plenty of ways to see how it stacks up against other models. Try it out and see what you think.\n\n---------------------------\n\nStay Updated:- Follow Build Fast with AI pages for all the latest AI updates and resources.\n\nExperts predict 2025 will be the defining year for Gen AI Implementation.

Lead the way in building the future of artificial intelligence.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the fast-paced world of data management and AI-driven solutions, transforming unstructured data into structured formats is essential for businesses, researchers, and developers alike. Llama Parse emerges as a cutting-edge tool for handling unstructured data sources like PDFs, HTML, and text files. This versatile tool simplifies large-scale data parsing, integrates seamlessly with workflows, and boosts productivity by enabling AI-powered applications.\n\nIn this blog, we will take a deep dive into Llama Parse’s capabilities and demonstrate how to use it to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline over legal documents. A RAG pipeline enables efficient information retrieval from vast data repositories, combined with generative AI capabilities to synthesize insights. This guide will cover every step, from setup and installation to querying parsed data with advanced LLMs like GPT-4o.\n\nBy the end of this blog, you will understand how to:\n\nLet’s get started!\n\nDetailed Explanation\n\nBefore diving into parsing and querying, we need to ensure all necessary tools are installed and properly configured. The first step involves installing the core libraries: llama-index and llama-parse.\n\nThese libraries enable parsing unstructured data and building advanced indexing mechanisms. Once installed, we set up environment variables to securely store API keys. These keys are necessary for accessing Llama Parse’s cloud services and OpenAI’s GPT models:\n\nEnvironment variables ensure sensitive information, like API keys, are not hard-coded in the scripts. This practice minimizes security risks and ensures compatibility across different systems.\n\nLlama Parse can be applied in:\n\nWith the setup complete, we move on to acquiring and preparing the dataset.\n\nTo demonstrate Llama Parse’s capabilities, we will use a sample dataset of US legal documents. Download and extract the dataset using the following commands:\n\nThe dataset consists of multiple legal documents stored in various formats. These documents contain critical information that needs to be extracted and structured for further analysis. Examples include:\n\nOnce downloaded, the files are ready for parsing.\n\nParsing is the core feature of Llama Parse. This tool processes unstructured data and converts it into structured formats like Markdown or JSON. Here’s how to set up the parser:\n\nThe parsing process generates structured Markdown documents containing:\n\nThis structured format simplifies downstream processing and analysis.\n\nLegal professionals can use parsed documents for:\n\nOnce the documents are parsed, the next step is creating an index. A vectorized index allows efficient querying and retrieval of information. Here’s how to build and persist the index:\n\nA vectorized index converts text into numerical representations (embeddings), enabling fast and accurate searches. This is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets like legal repositories.\n\nThe final step is querying the indexed documents. Llama Index’s query engine provides answers by leveraging the power of GPT models:\n\nThe responses are rendered in Markdown format, providing concise and accurate answers. For example:\n\nQuery: “Who is against the proposal of offshore drilling in CA and why?”\n\nResponse:\n\nConclusion\n\nLlama Parse is revolutionizing the way we handle unstructured data. By converting complex documents into structured formats, it simplifies workflows and unlocks the potential of AI-driven insights. This blog has covered:\n\nWith these tools and techniques, you can streamline data processing and empower AI-driven decision-making in any domain.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nStay Updated:- Follow Build Fast with AI pages for all the latest AI updates and resources.\n\nExperts predict 2025 will be the defining year for Gen AI implementation.Want to be ahead of the curve?\n\nJoin Build Fast with AI’s Gen AI Launch Pad 2025 - your accelerated path to mastering AI tools and building revolutionary applications.\n\n* Legal document analysis\n* Extracting data from financial reports\n* Parsing and structuring academic research papers\n* Preparing datasets for machine learning models\n\n* Contracts\n* Court rulings\n* Regulatory compliance reports\n\n* result_type: Specifies the format of the parsed output.

Chonkie-AI is a powerful Python library designed to break down large bodies of text into meaningful chunks, optimizing retrieval and processing. This blog explores how Chonkie-AI works, its various chunking methods, and how to integrate it into a practical pipeline.\n\nBy the end of this post, you will:\n\nBefore using Chonkie-AI, install the required libraries with the following command:\n\nEach library in this installation command serves a distinct purpose:\n\nThese dependencies work together to create a complete pipeline for document chunking, embedding, retrieval, and processing.\n\nChonkie-AI offers multiple chunking techniques to process text efficiently. Below are the main methods:\n\nChunkerDescriptionTokenChunkerSplits text into fixed-size token chunks.WordChunkerChunks text based on word count.SentenceChunkerSplits text at sentence boundaries.RecursiveChunkerUses hierarchical splitting with customizable rules.SemanticChunkerGroups text based on semantic similarity.SDPMChunkerUses a Semantic Double-Pass Merge approach.LateChunker (Experimental)Embeds text first, then chunks for better embeddings.\n\nEach of these methods is suited for different types of text processing needs. For example, TokenChunker ensures that text segments remain within a model's token limits, while RecursiveChunker provides hierarchical segmentation ideal for structured documents.\n\nThis block of code imports the necessary libraries to initialize a token-based chunking method. The TokenChunker class is designed to split text into fixed token-sized segments, ensuring efficient processing within models that have token constraints. The GPT-2 tokenizer is used here because it provides byte-level encoding, making it compatible with various NLP tasks.\n\nHere, we create an instance of TokenChunker and pass the GPT-2 tokenizer as an argument. This allows us to chunk text while respecting GPT-2 tokenization rules, ensuring optimal token usage when working with transformer models.\n\nThis command passes a string into the TokenChunker, which will split it into token-based segments.\n\nThis loop iterates through each chunk and prints the text along with the token count.\n\nHere, the total number of tokens in the sentence is 24, which fits within most models' token limits.\n\nThe RecursiveChunker is a more sophisticated chunking method that applies hierarchical splitting rules, making it ideal for structured documents.\n\nThis step applies the recursive chunking rules to the input document and counts the resulting chunks.\n\nThe text is divided into 57 meaningful segments, making it easier to retrieve relevant information in RAG applications.\n\nTo deepen your understanding of text chunking for RAG, embeddings, and retrieval systems, check out the following resources:\n\nChonkie-AI is a versatile and powerful library for text chunking, catering to multiple use cases in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), NLP, and AI-powered search engines. By using different chunking techniques like token-based, sentence-based, recursive, and semantic chunking, developers can optimize document processing for large language models.\n\n---------------------------\n\nStay Updated:- Follow Build Fast with AI pages for all the latest AI updates and resources.\n\nExperts predict 2025 will be the defining year for Gen AI Implementation.

The second best time? Right after reading this post.\n\nAs natural language processing (NLP) continues to evolve, integrating frameworks that enhance control and structure is becoming increasingly critical. NLP models, while powerful, often produce outputs that lack consistency or violate specific rules, leading to potential issues in production environments. Tools like Guardrails and LangChain address these challenges by providing mechanisms to validate and enforce structured outputs from language models.\n\nThis blog post explores the integration of these two tools, focusing on their synergy in creating robust AI workflows. You’ll learn:\n\nBy the end, you’ll have a solid understanding of how to leverage these tools to improve the reliability and usability of AI-generated content.\n\nBefore diving into the integration, it’s essential to set up the required libraries and tools. Here's the foundational setup:\n\nThis command ensures that the Guardrails, LangChain, and OpenAI libraries are available in your Python environment. These libraries form the backbone of the integration.\n\nKey Libraries:\n\nTip: Ensure you have an OpenAI API key for seamless access to GPT-based models. If you don’t have an API key, you can sign up at OpenAI's platform.\n\nFor users working in team environments or deploying applications, consider using virtual environments to isolate dependencies. This can prevent conflicts between project requirements.\n\nGuardrails operates based on a YAML-based specification file known as a \"rail\". This file defines the structure and validation rules for the model’s output. The beauty of this approach is that it decouples the schema definition from the application code, making it highly reusable and easy to modify.\n\nExample Rail File (sample_rail.yml):\n\nBreakdown:\n\nThis rail enforces that the output must be an object containing title, description, and published_date fields, with the published_date conforming to a date format. By specifying this schema, Guardrails ensures that the language model’s outputs are predictable and usable.\n\nLangChain simplifies the orchestration of language model tasks, and its integration with Guardrails ensures the outputs meet predefined criteria.\n\nHere’s a sample code snippet demonstrating how to combine the two:\n\nExplanation:\n\nExpected Output:\n\nThe result is a JSON object that adheres to the specified schema. For instance:\n\nThis structured output is especially useful in applications requiring reliable, machine-readable data.\n\nThe integration of Guardrails with LangChain opens up numerous possibilities across various industries. Here are some detailed examples:\n\n1.Content Management Systems (CMS):\n\n2.E-commerce:\n\n3.Data Entry Automation:\n\n4.Healthcare:\n\nBy enforcing structure and consistency, this integration reduces the risk of errors and enhances the reliability of AI applications.\n\nBy combining Guardrails and LangChain, developers can achieve unparalleled control over AI outputs, ensuring reliability and adherence to predefined schemas. This blog covered:\n\nThis integration is a testament to the evolving landscape of AI development, where frameworks and tools work in harmony to address real-world challenges. As you explore these tools further, consider how they can be adapted to your specific use cases.

ML-enabled systems use various algorithms to first learn patterns and then make predictions or decisions based on new or unseen inputs. Some examples of ML applications are spam email filters, personalized shopping recommendations, and predictive text suggestions.\n\nDeep Learning (DL) is a specialized branch of Machine Learning that uses Neural Networks with many layers (alluding to \"Deep\" in Deep Learning) to learn even more complex patterns in vast datasets. These networks are designed to mimic the human brain's structure and function and can learn abstract concepts given a large amount of data. This enables machines to recognize specific categories of images, understand speech patterns, and even play games that require superhuman levels of intelligence. All the modern-day AI breakthroughs are powered by Deep Learning, prominently advanced image recognition, and natural language understanding.\n\nGenerative AI (GenAI) is a subfield of Deep Learning where Neural Networks are trained specifically to create new content, such as images, text, music, and more, by learning fundamental properties of the data they were trained on. Unlike the general Deep Learning domain (Traditional AI), which focuses on analyzing data and predicting specific outcomes, Generative AI aims to produce new data that mostly resembles the property of the data it was trained on. Think of a Neural Network trained on existing people's images to generate realistic images of people nonexistent. This technology is behind innovations like AI-generated art, chatbots that can write essays, and virtual musicians that compose original songs. This has been fueled by the digital age now that a vast amount of data is available to consume on the internet.\n\nGenerative AI applications are different from Traditional AI (Deep Learning based) applications — let's dive deeper into specific aspects.\n\nWhat does it do?\n\nWhere is it applied?\n\nWhat data is used to train the model?\n\nHow is it Delivered?\n\nWho can train it for their use cases?\n\nNow that we understand what Generative AI is, let's briefly learn about how it works. Here's an easy-to-digest workflow, followed by a textual explanation:\n\nThe process begins with data pre-processing, where raw data is cleaned, normalized, and prepared to ensure it is suitable for model training. This is followed by training the GenAI model, enabling it to learn patterns and relationships within the data. Following this, these special models use the learned patterns to generate new data probabilistically, simulating potential variations and outcomes. This step is where Generative AI models deviate from Traditional AI models since the latter are not trained to generate data. The final step of incorporating feedback involves human reviewers who assess the quality, relevance, accuracy, and overall alignment of the generated data with the intended goals. Based on the collected feedback, models are adjusted by fine-tuning the parameters, incorporating new training data, or altering their algorithms to better align with human expectations. This cyclical process ensures high-quality data generation through the Generative AI models.\n\nNow, you may ask: what are these Generative AI models? They are Deep Learning or Neural Network based models (see the Venn Diagram above for domain overlap) under the hood. These networks, inspired by the human brain, ingest vast amounts of data through layers of interconnected nodes (neurons), which then process and decipher patterns in it. These networks can then be used to generate new data following the same patterns — allowing us to create diverse content, from graphics and multimedia to text and even music. Although details are out of scope for this post, these are the three popular architectures for implementing Generative AI:\n\nPlease feel free to comment if you want us to provide intuitive explanations of these architectures in our future posts.\n\nGenerative AI can aid in generating fresh content, streamline operations, and deliver tailored experiences by leveraging advanced algorithms. Following are some key non-exhaustive ways Generative AI can provide value for you:\n\nDue to diverse applications, Generative AI can be applied to content creation, art and design, healthcare, entertainment, education, product development, and customer service to name a few sectors.\n\nNow that we know what is Generative AI, how it works, and where it can be applied, we want to provide a quick peek at different types of Generative AI models, based on the input data they can ingest and output data they generate. We may all know the popular ChatGPT; however, there are many more Generative AI models that can be categorized by the use cases they serve. For example, DALL-E and MidJourney generate stunning images from textual descriptions, while models like Claude and Gemini are tailored for natural language processing tasks such as summarization and content generation. Additionally, models like MusicLM specialize in creating music, and Codex is designed for generating and understanding code, showcasing the diverse applications of Generative AI across different domains. Here's a quick overview:\n\nIf any X-to-Y application mentioned above intrigues you, feel free to try out the tools we have highlighted.

Gen AI Launch Pad’s 6-week transformation.\n\nJoin Build Fast with AI’s Gen AI Launch Pad 2025 - your accelerated path to mastering AI tools and building revolutionary applications.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) systems are becoming indispensable in industries ranging from healthcare to finance. However, the rapid adoption of AI models raises critical questions about their reliability, fairness, and security. Addressing these concerns is essential to prevent unintended consequences and build trust in AI systems. Giskard, an open-source Python library, provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating and testing AI models. This guide explores Giskard’s powerful capabilities, from setup and integration to model evaluation, showcasing a practical example of building a climate-focused question-answering (QA) system using LangChain and OpenAI models.\n\nBy the end of this blog, you will understand:\n\nBefore we delve into model creation and evaluation, it is crucial to install Giskard and its dependencies. Use the following command to set up your environment:\n\nThis installation includes:\n\nGiskard acts as the foundation for testing, while LangChain and FAISS simplify the creation of AI models that require advanced document retrieval and processing capabilities. These libraries are especially useful for building QA models based on extensive textual data.\n\nTo access OpenAI’s language models, you need to securely set up your API key. The following snippet ensures this is done correctly:\n\nThis snippet retrieves your OpenAI API key securely from Colab’s user data. Replace this with your preferred method of securely handling API keys if you’re not using Google Colab.\n\nNow that we’ve set up the environment, let’s build an AI model to answer climate-related questions using data from the IPCC Climate Change Synthesis Report (2023).\n\nThe first step in creating a QA model is to preprocess the document and store it in a retrievable format. We use LangChain’s text processing and FAISS for this purpose:\n\nThis step doesn’t produce a direct output but prepares a vector database (db) that can be queried for retrieving relevant text chunks.\n\nThis preprocessing pipeline is essential for tasks like:\n\nA well-designed prompt ensures the language model generates accurate and contextually relevant answers. Here is the prompt template:\n\nPrompt templates standardize the input to the language model, ensuring consistent responses across different queries. This is particularly important for domain-specific tasks where precision and clarity are paramount.\n\nCombine the vector store and prompt template to build a retrieval-based QA system:\n\nTest the QA chain with a query:\n\nExpected Output:\n\nTo enable Giskard’s evaluation and testing functionalities, wrap the QA chain:\n\nCreate a dataset of example queries for testing:\n\nThe model generates context-aware answers to each query based on the IPCC report.\n\nRun Giskard’s scan to detect issues:\n\nThis scan identifies vulnerabilities such as:\n\nSave the report for further analysis or sharing.\n\nGiskard can generate test suites from the scan:\n\nAutomated test suites enable continuous validation of model quality during development.\n\nThis guide demonstrated how to:\n\n---------------------------------\n\nStay Updated:- Follow Build Fast with AI pages for all the latest AI updates and resources.\n\nExperts predict 2025 will be the defining year for Gen AI implementation.Want to be ahead of the curve?\n\nJoin Build Fast with AI’s Gen AI Launch Pad 2025 - your accelerated path to mastering AI tools and building revolutionary applications.\n\n* Giskard: For AI evaluation and testing.\n* LangChain: For building composable language model pipelines.\n* FAISS: For efficient similarity search and clustering.\n* PyPDFLoader: For processing PDF documents.\n\n* PyPDFLoader: Downloads and processes the IPCC PDF report into text format.\n* RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter: Splits the document into smaller chunks (1000 characters) with overlaps to preserve context.\n* FAISS: Converts these chunks into a searchable vector database using OpenAI embeddings.\n\n* Document search engines.\n* Legal document analysis.\n* Summarization of extensive reports.\n\n* RetrievalQA: Retrieves relevant chunks from the vector database (db) and passes them to the language model (llm) for generating an answer.\n* OpenAI’s gpt-4o: The underlying language model for generating responses.\n\n* \"Sea level rise is largely unavoidable due to current warming levels.

The second best time? Right after reading this post.\n\nIn this blog, we'll explore a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of an intelligent memory system for personalized AI. This system enhances how AI interacts with users by storing and retrieving relevant data to provide context-aware responses.\n\nPersonalized AI systems have become a cornerstone of applications like virtual assistants, recommendation engines, and conversational agents. By simulating memory, these systems can adapt to users' unique preferences and histories, creating a more engaging experience. This blog will guide you through the steps to build such a system, complete with code snippets, explanations, and real-world applications. By the end of this post, you'll understand the key components of such a system, how to implement it in Python, and its potential real-world applications.\n\nThe first step involves importing essential libraries and setting up the environment. Here's the corresponding code snippet:\n\nThese libraries form the backbone of our system, enabling it to handle files, store data efficiently, and track events chronologically. Additionally, ensure you have these libraries installed and available in your Python environment before proceeding.\n\nThe core of the system is its memory model, which organizes and stores data. Below is the code for defining the memory structure:\n\nThis setup ensures that the memory is well-structured and can grow dynamically as new data is added. The use of JSON makes it lightweight and easy to manipulate.\n\nThis function is useful when setting up AI systems that require a clean memory state, such as chatbots or recommendation engines. For example, when deploying a new conversational AI model, initializing memory ensures it starts with a blank slate.\n\nMemory initialization can also be extended to prepopulate default entries. For instance, initializing memory with frequently asked questions (FAQs) or default user preferences can enhance user experience from the start.\n\nTo make the memory system dynamic, we need a way to add new entries. Here's how it's done:\n\nImagine you have a customer support chatbot. When a user asks a question, the chatbot can log the query and user information as an entry:\n\nThis allows the chatbot to remember past interactions and provide more personalized responses in future conversations.\n\nWhen adding an entry like {\"user\": \"Alice\", \"query\": \"What is AI?\"}, the memory JSON file will be updated to include this data. An example file could look like this:\n\nTo handle large-scale data, consider integrating a database like SQLite or MongoDB instead of JSON files. This ensures scalability and faster access.\n\nEfficient retrieval is critical for contextual responses. Below is the retrieval logic:\n\nUse this function in personalized recommendation systems or chatbots to fetch contextually relevant data for user queries. For instance, if a user asks, \"What is my last search?\", this function can quickly retrieve the most recent relevant entry.\n\nQuerying \"Alice\" might return:\n\nFor larger datasets, consider indexing the memory entries or using a database with optimized search capabilities to reduce query time.\n\nTo better understand stored data, visualizations can be helpful. For instance, plotting memory usage over time:\n\nInclude a line graph demonstrating the accumulation of memory entries over time. You can also experiment with bar charts to show the frequency of specific queries or users.\n\nVisualizations can help identify trends, such as peak usage times or common user queries. This insight is valuable for improving AI system performance.\n\nBuilding an intelligent memory system involves:\n\nThese components form the foundation of personalized AI systems capable of delivering context-aware responses. Readers are encouraged to experiment with the code and extend it to meet specific use cases, such as sentiment analysis or predictive modeling.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nStay Updated:- Follow Build Fast with AI pages for all the latest AI updates and resources.\n\nExperts predict 2025 will be the defining year for Gen AI implementation.Want to be ahead of the curve?\n\nJoin Build Fast with AI’s Gen AI Launch Pad 2025 - your accelerated path to mastering AI tools and building revolutionary applications.\n\n* os: Provides functions to interact with the operating system, such as managing files and directories.

Langroid simplifies this process, making it easier to develop, test, and deploy LLM-powered agents. This blog post will walk through a Jupyter notebook demonstrating Langroid's capabilities, explaining each code snippet, and highlighting key concepts.\n\nTo get started, we need to install Langroid and import necessary libraries:\n\nThis sets up Langroid and its logging system, which provides color-coded logs for better debugging and tracking. The setup_colored_logging() function ensures that different types of messages (e.g., warnings, errors, information logs) are easily distinguishable.\n\nWe define a configuration for our chat agent, specifying parameters such as verbosity and response behavior.\n\nThis sends a user query to the chat agent and prints the model’s response. The output would be a detailed explanation of Langroid. The response depends on the underlying LLM being used.\n\nLangroid enables structured interactions, allowing us to define custom behavior.\n\nBy default, LLMs process each query independently. Langroid supports conversation memory:\n\nThis ensures that previous interactions are considered in subsequent responses, making conversations more context-aware.\n\nThis limits responses to 100 tokens, ensuring concise and efficient replies. Token limits help control cost and prevent excessively long responses that may be redundant.\n\nThis streams responses chunk by chunk, enhancing real-time interactions. This is useful for applications like AI-driven assistants where immediate feedback is necessary.\n\nLangroid can generate conversational logs and insights. We can use Matplotlib for basic visualizations:\n\nWhen working with Langroid, debugging is crucial to handle potential issues like missing responses, high latency, or unexpected behavior. Common strategies include:\n\nThis ensures that errors are gracefully caught and logged instead of crashing the program.\n\nLangroid is ideal for:\n\nLangroid significantly simplifies LLM-powered agent development, providing a robust framework for building intelligent conversational AI. By using memory, streaming, and response control, developers can enhance chatbot interactions and optimize efficiency.\n\nLangroid’s modularity makes it adaptable for various use cases, from simple Q&A bots to complex enterprise solutions.

Right after reading this post.\n\nWhat is ChromaDB?\n\nSure! Let's expand the blog post further, diving deeper into each section and explaining the process with more details, examples, and context around ChromaDB and its use cases. Here’s an extended version of the blog:\n\nIn the rapidly evolving field of machine learning and AI, embeddings play a pivotal role in representing complex data in a simplified and useful manner. Whether you're working with text, images, or any other form of data, embeddings help convert these entities into numerical representations that can be easily processed by machine learning models.\n\nTo manage, query, and store these embeddings efficiently, a vector database like ChromaDB is often used. ChromaDB provides the infrastructure necessary to handle large amounts of vector data, enabling rapid similarity searches, content-based retrieval, and machine learning applications. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about ChromaDB, from installation to advanced use cases.\n\nChromaDB is an advanced vector database optimized for storing and querying embeddings. Embeddings are high-dimensional vectors that capture the essence of objects in a form that a machine can understand. For example, an image embedding is a vector of numbers that represents the content of the image in such a way that similar images will have similar vectors.\n\nChromaDB leverages these embeddings and stores them in a way that makes it fast and efficient to retrieve them based on similarity. It is especially useful in the following contexts:\n\nAt its core, ChromaDB stores embeddings in a vector format. These vectors can be generated from different kinds of data sources, such as images, text, audio, etc. ChromaDB allows you to insert, retrieve, and query these vectors efficiently using advanced indexing algorithms designed to minimize the time required for searching through large datasets.\n\nApplications of ChromaDB include:\n\nBefore you can use ChromaDB, you need to set up the necessary libraries and tools. The notebook we’re referencing uses the following Python libraries:\n\nYou can install these libraries using the following command:\n\nThis command installs everything you need to begin working with ChromaDB, including the pre-trained models required for generating embeddings. Once these libraries are installed, you can proceed to load and process your datasets.\n\nOnce the required libraries are installed, the next step is to load and visualize the dataset. In the notebook, we are dealing with image data, and the first operation typically involves loading these images for processing.\n\nThis code block loads the images, which will then be converted into embeddings and stored in the ChromaDB. The embeddings serve as the compact numerical representations of the images, allowing you to later perform similarity searches or other queries based on these embeddings.\n\nIn this example, we load a dataset and display the first image in the dataset. Visualization is an important step when working with image data because it lets you confirm that the images have been loaded correctly before further processing.\n\nAfter the images have been loaded, the next step is to convert them into embeddings using a pre-trained model. In this case, we use OpenCLIP, a version of CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining) that is optimized for generating embeddings from images.\n\nHere’s how you can generate embeddings for images using OpenCLIP:\n\nWhat are embeddings?\n\nOnce the embeddings are generated, they can be stored and queried within a vector database like ChromaDB.\n\nAfter generating the embeddings, the next step is to store them in ChromaDB for fast access and retrieval. In this step, we initialize a ChromaDB client, create a collection to hold the embeddings, and then insert the embeddings along with any relevant metadata (such as the image ID or description).\n\nHere’s how you can add your image embeddings to ChromaDB:\n\nIn this code:\n\nOne of the main advantages of using ChromaDB is its ability to quickly retrieve embeddings that are similar to a given query embedding. For example, if you want to find images that are visually similar to a query image, you can generate its embedding and perform a similarity search.\n\nHere’s how you can query the database for similar images:\n\nIn this code:\n\nNow that we understand how to load data, generate embeddings, and query ChromaDB, let’s explore some real-world applications of this technology:\n\nIn e-commerce, visual search allows users to upload an image of a product and find similar items. For example, if a customer uploads an image of a pair of shoes, the system can return similar shoes available for purchase on the platform.\n\nChromaDB makes this process seamless by storing embeddings of products and querying the most visually similar items in real-time.\n\nRecommendation systems use embeddings to suggest content that is related to what a user has interacted with in the past. By storing embeddings of items such as movies, books, or songs, ChromaDB enables recommendation systems to provide personalized suggestions based on a user's preferences.\n\nIn machine learning, embeddings are often used in downstream tasks such as clustering, classification, and semantic analysis. ChromaDB provides an efficient storage solution for embeddings, making it easier to build scalable machine learning pipelines.\n\nChromaDB is a powerful and efficient vector database that provides a simple yet robust way to store, retrieve, and query embeddings. Whether you're building a visual search system, recommendation engine, or integrating embeddings into a machine learning pipeline, ChromaDB offers the tools you need to manage high-dimensional data efficiently.\n\nThrough this guide, we’ve walked through the key steps of setting up, generating embeddings, and performing similarity searches with ChromaDB. Now that you have a better understanding of how to work with ChromaDB, you can start integrating it into your own projects and unlock the power of embeddings in your AI applications.\n\nIf you’re interested in leveraging ChromaDB for your own projects, make sure to explore its official documentation and experiment with different datasets and models!\n\n---------------------------------\n\nStay Updated:- Follow Build Fast with AI pages for all the latest AI updates and resources.\n\nExperts predict 2025 will be the defining year for Gen AI implementation.Want to be ahead of the curve?\n\nJoin Build Fast with AI’s Gen AI Launch Pad 2025 - your accelerated path to mastering AI tools and building revolutionary applications.\n\n* Visual Search: For applications that require finding similar images, such as in e-commerce platforms, social media, or content management systems.\n* Recommendation Systems: ChromaDB can be used to suggest products, movies, books, or any other kind of item based on a user's preferences or past behavior.\n* Machine Learning Pipelines: Storing embeddings generated from text, images, or other data types for use in tasks like classification, clustering, and semantic analysis.\n\n* Visual Search: Finding similar images or other multimedia content.\n* Recommendation Systems: Suggesting related content or products.\n* Machine Learning Pipelines: Storing embeddings for tasks such as clustering, classification, or semantic analysis.\n\n* datasets – This is a popular library for accessing a variety of datasets, including those for image, text, and audio processing.\n* chromadb – This is the core library for working with ChromaDB, which provides the functionality for managing and querying vector databases.\n* open-clip-torch – A library for working with OpenCLIP models, which are used to generate embeddings from text and images.\n\n* Embeddings are dense vectors of floating-point numbers that represent the content of an image, text, or any other data.\n* The model we’re using here, OpenCLIP, has been trained on massive datasets and can generate embeddings that capture semantic meaning.

One powerful open-source framework for building intelligent, document-based chatbots is Embedchain. This framework allows developers to integrate various data sources, such as websites, PDFs, and text documents, with advanced language models to create interactive AI assistants.\n\nIn this blog post, we will explore Embedchain in depth, walking through installation, configuration, data integration, and querying. By the end, you will have a solid understanding of how to build your own AI chatbot using Embedchain.\n\nBefore building our chatbot, we need to install Embedchain and its dependencies.\n\nEmbedchain requires ChromaDB, a vector database for efficient data retrieval. Install both using pip:\n\nThis installs the core libraries required to store and query data effectively.\n\nTo use language models like OpenAI's GPT or Cohere, we need to configure API keys:\n\nThis ensures the chatbot can generate responses using LLMs.\n\nOnce the dependencies are set up, we can create an Embedchain app with a vector database (ChromaDB in this case).\n\nThis setup enables us to store and retrieve knowledge from documents and web sources.\n\nEmbedchain allows us to ingest data from a website for chatbot interaction.\n\nExpected Output:\n\nWe can also integrate PDF documents into our chatbot:\n\nAfter adding data, we can interact with the chatbot by asking questions:\n\nInput:\n\nOutput:\n\nTo enhance output readability in Jupyter notebooks, we can format responses as Markdown:\n\nThis allows the chatbot’s responses to be presented in a structured format.\n\nInstead of OpenAI, we can use Cohere as the language model provider:\n\nWe have explored how Embedchain simplifies the creation of AI-powered, document-based chatbots. From installing dependencies and adding data sources to querying and displaying results, this framework enables rapid chatbot development with minimal effort.\n\n---------------------------\n\nStay Updated:- Follow Build Fast with AI pages for all the latest AI updates and resources.\n\nExperts predict 2025 will be the defining year for Gen AI Implementation.

LLMs can write code too, can't they?\n\nIn that case, we need to define the terms a bit more precisely:\n\nAn AI software engineer is an AI assistant that can look at multiple code files in a git repository, and can determine which files to change depending on the exact task the assistant is trying to carry out.\n\nFor example, suppose you have a repository where you're working on an AI project, and you need to fix some bug where the AI assistant is not loading properly whenever the user selects the Mistral model.\n\nAs a software engineer, you need to find the file containing the bug AND fix it. (Image by author)\n\nAs a software engineer, you would need to first find out which code file to change to fix the bug. For example, you could check in the file where the model is loaded if the issue can be figured out there. If there is some variable or function involved in the corresponding code that's imported from another file, you would go through those files too as potential sources of the bug.\n\nA regular LLM couldn't solve this issue, since we can't provide all the files into the LLM whenever we're asking a question. We'd probably have to find the file ourselves before passing it into the LLM asking it to fix the bug.\n\nAn AI software engineer, just like a regular software engineer, executes incremental PRs (pull requests) to fix some aspect of the code. For instance, if we want to create an AI assistant with improved reasoning ability, the first PR might involve setting up the AI assistant, the second might involve setting up the training workflow, and so on.\n\nEach PR is a commit that expands the code base.\n\nAn AI assistant would need to write code for these PRs sequentially, either on its own or prompted by the user.\n\nWhat the AI software engineer might do to execute some task provided by the user/boss.\n\nWith the recent DeepSeek model, you might be curious as to whether LLMs could use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn to be better software engineers. I wrote a blog recently about how versatile the RL training technique is, which you should check out if you haven't already.\n\nRL is super versatile because LLMs develop the ability to solve a problem on their own without having to explicitly teach them.\n\nCan we do the same for the software engineering task?\n\nLet's first define the task.\n\nOur goal is to get our AI assistant to automatically make the required changes in a repository given the current state of the repository and the task to be completed, just like a software engineer would.\n\nTo get an AI to do the same thing, we'll use the same RL training pipeline that DeepSeek used to improve reasoning.\n\nRL is a super generalisable technique. This means that applying it in one context (to improve reasoning) can allow it to work better in other contexts too. That means whatever DeepSeek did to improve reasoning probably improves its performance on our task as well.\n\nBut can we make it even better by explicitly using software engineering examples to teach it?\n\nTo carry this out, we first need to collect some data to train the LLM.\n\nTo train the LLM, we need to collect data that can teach it what changes to make, given:\n\nGit PRs.\n\nA Git PR (Pull Request) is basically a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch to another. When you're working on a project using GitHub, you would usually make changes to the repository, and then commit those changes with a commit message that describes the task you completed. You would then pull the current state of the repository and merge your changes with the repository.\n\nThus, a pull request has all the information we need — previous state of the repository, the task to be completed, and the changes made to complete that task.\n\nThus, if we collect the millions of pull requests on public repositories, we should have a decent bit of information to start teaching the LLM how to change the code given the task to be completed and the old state of the code.\n\nNow that we have a dataset, we need to figure out how to prompt the LLM during the training process, or during inference.\n\nWe want to provide the old state of the code and the task to be completed from the dataset, expecting it to output the changes to be made.\n\nBut the entire code can't be uploaded, so we might decide to only provide two types of files:\n\nWe can use an LLM to determine the relevant files that didn't change based on the file names. The idea is that the LLM should not only know which files to change but also the files it shouldn't change, so incorporating this into the training process is essential to help it learn.\n\nComing to the exact RL process, how do we define the reward to provide incentives to the LLM to learn?\n\nWe're going to define the reward in a simple way: quantify the difference between the output code of the LLM and the actual new state of the file in the PR. The more similar they are, the higher the reward.\n\nThe overall process is simple: pass each data point into the LLM, extract the output, compare the output against the expected output code, and provide a reward based on the sequence similarity. The LLM alters its policy to optimise the overall reward.\n\nIt's been shown that increasing the difficulty of problems as the RL training loop progresses helps the LLM learn more effectively, just as it would help a student learn more effectively.\n\nSince currently, we took PRs in a random order from public repositories on GitHub, we could order them based on the size of the commit, i.e., the number of changes made within the commit, with the assumption that commits involving fewer changes are easier to reason than others.\n\nAlternately, we could think of another metric to judge the difficulty of reasoning within each PR and order the data points in increasing difficulty.\n\nThe cleanliness of the dataset is one of the major bottlenecks when it comes to improving LLM performance at the end of the RL training process. DeepSeek and other researchers have shown this extensively.\n\nThe idea of an AI software engineer isn't that far away. And it will probably soon be open-sourced and therefore highly accessible to software developers across the world.\n\nWe went over one possible approach to build an AI software engineer. The process itself could be made more efficient through various ways. Training LLMs with RL is still a nascent field, with so many low-hanging fruits and a lot of potential for research. I'm personally getting into this field this year, and if any of you are interested, I'd recommend exploring it too.\n\n---------------------------\n\nStay Updated:- Follow Build Fast with AI pages for all the latest AI updates and resources.\n\nExperts predict 2025 will be the defining year for Gen AI Implementation.

GPTCache is a powerful caching library designed to optimize the performance of Large Language Model (LLM) applications by storing and reusing previous responses. This not only reduces redundant API calls but also enhances user experience with faster response times.\n\nIn this blog, we’ll explore the capabilities of GPTCache, break down the code required to integrate it into AI applications, and discuss best practices for maximizing efficiency. Whether you're working on chatbots, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, or other AI-driven applications, this guide will help you unlock the full potential of GPTCache.\n\nBefore integrating GPTCache into your AI workflow, you need to install the required dependencies. The following command installs GPTCache along with other necessary packages:\n\nTo use the OpenAI API, you need to set up an API key in your environment:\n\nReal-World Use Case: If your application repeatedly receives the same or similar queries, caching responses prevents unnecessary API calls, reducing costs and improving user experience.\n\nLet’s first observe the standard OpenAI API call without caching:\n\nAnalysis: Every time the same question is asked, an API call is made, leading to additional cost and increased latency.\n\nTo speed up responses, let’s initialize GPTCache:\n\nBenefit: Once caching is enabled, repeated queries will return instantly without making API requests.\n\nObservation: The second call is significantly faster because GPTCache retrieves the answer without querying the API.\n\nTo enhance caching capabilities, we use similarity-based search with ONNX and FAISS:\n\nUse Case: If users ask slightly different variations of the same question (e.g., \"What is GitHub?\", \"Tell me about GitHub\"), GPTCache retrieves a previously stored response instead of generating a new one.\n\nFor applications that require strict matching, GPTCache supports exact match evaluation:\n\nGPTCache is a game-changer for optimizing LLM applications, offering significant reductions in API costs and response times. By leveraging exact match caching, semantic search with ONNX and FAISS, and adaptive caching policies, developers can enhance the efficiency of AI applications in production.\n\n---------------------------\n\nStay Updated:- Follow Build Fast with AI pages for all the latest AI updates and resources.\n\nExperts predict 2025 will be the defining year for Gen AI Implementation.

Creating an Atlas Map for English-German Translations\n\nWill you let others shape the future for you, or will you lead the way?\n\nGen AI Launch Pad 2025 is your moment to shine.\n\nIn the age of big data, the ability to analyze, structure, and visualize large datasets has become crucial. Nomic, an open-source platform, facilitates this process by allowing users to manage diverse datasets (text, images, audio, embeddings, and video) efficiently. Whether you're building a data science project, conducting exploratory data analysis, or performing in-depth data visualization, Nomic can provide the tools needed for these tasks.\n\nIn this blog post, we’ll walk through a series of code blocks that showcase how to leverage Nomic for various data processing tasks. By the end of this tutorial, you’ll understand how to set up Nomic, load datasets, generate embeddings, clean data, and visualize complex data structures—all using Nomic's powerful features.\n\nBefore we dive into data processing, you need to set up the necessary environment. The following snippet shows how to install Nomic and log in:\n\nExplanation:\n\nExpected Output: No direct output; however, successful login ensures access to Nomic's Atlas and other tools.\n\nWhen to Use: You will use this step at the beginning of your Nomic-based project setup, particularly if you plan to work in a cloud-based notebook environment like Google Colab.\n\nThe following code loads the AG News dataset, a collection of news articles, and selects a random subset of 10,000 documents:\n\nExplanation:\n\nExpected Output: This step won’t produce a visual output but will store the 10,000 random documents in memory for further processing.\n\nWhen to Use: Use this when you need to work with a subset of a large dataset for faster experimentation, especially when you don't need the entire dataset for training or analysis.\n\nNomic allows you to convert text documents into embeddings, which are vector representations that capture the semantic meaning of the text. Here's how to generate embeddings for the selected subset of documents:\n\nExplanation:\n\nExpected Output: The output will be a NumPy array of document embeddings with a shape that corresponds to the number of documents and the dimensionality of the embeddings.\n\nWhen to Use: This step is useful when you want to convert text data into machine-readable vectors for downstream tasks like clustering, similarity search, or training machine learning models.\n\nOnce the embeddings are generated, you can visualize them using Nomic’s Atlas. Here’s how to create a map for the AG News dataset:\n\nExplanation:\n\nExpected Output:\n\nWhen to Use: This step is useful for visualizing and exploring relationships between high-dimensional data points, such as in the case of text embeddings. Use it when you need to analyze large datasets visually.\n\nWith the map created, you can extract and group topics from the dataset. This helps in identifying dominant themes in the collection of documents.\n\nExplanation:\n\nExpected Output: A printed list of topics grouped by their most significant terms. The topics can be used to understand the major themes in your dataset.\n\nWhen to Use: Topic modeling is useful when analyzing large datasets of unstructured text. It helps uncover hidden patterns and insights, making it ideal for exploratory analysis and content categorization.\n\nIn this step, we use the IWSLT 2014 English-German translation dataset to create another map for bilingual data.\n\nExplanation:\n\nExpected Output: Similar to the previous step, this will create a bilingual map of the dataset in the Nomic Atlas, which can be visualized interactively.\n\nWhen to Use: This is particularly useful for multilingual data visualization, enabling insights into how different language pairs relate within a large corpus.\n\nIn this blog, we’ve explored how to use Nomic to manage, process, and visualize large-scale datasets. From loading datasets, generating embeddings, and cleaning data, to visualizing complex relationships and extracting topics, Nomic provides a comprehensive toolkit for working with big data. By following this guide, you should now be able to set up and use Nomic to unlock powerful insights from your datasets.\n\n---------------------------\n\nStay Updated:- Follow Build Fast with AI pages for all the latest AI updates and resources.\n\nExperts predict 2025 will be the defining year for Gen AI Implementation.

    "content": "## What Is MCP?\n\n## Can’t We Do It Without MCP?\n\n## MCP Architecture Overview\n\n## How MCP Works?\n\n## Conclusion\n\n## Resources and Community\n\n### Overview\n\n### Reference\n\nAre you waiting for the future to happen or ready to make it happen?\n\nDon’t miss your chance to join Gen AI Launch Pad 2025 and shape what’s next.\n\nIn 2024 November, Anthropic introduced a new protocol named MCP (Model Context Protocol) which provides a standard method to connect external data sources and tools with LLMs. Let’s breakdown what this protocol is and why we need that. For now, MCP is compatible with Claude. But it can be used with other LLMs.\n\nBefore the USB ports came, there were different ports for connecting devices to the computer. PS/2 port is for keyboard and mouse. The VGA port is for monitors, etc. But after the USB port comes, it gives a standard interface to connect the device to the computer. Every device can connect with a computer using a USB port. It eliminates the need for a custom interface for each device and introduces a universal method to connect. MCP is also like this. It is like a USB port for LLMs. Tools, external data sources can connect to LLMs using MCP through a standard mechanism. So, no need to write custom integration for every single tool and data source anymore. MCP provides one standard way to connect all of this.\n\nAbsolutely we can connect tools and data sources to LLMs without MCP. Also, currently most of us do it without MCP. But the thing is when we do it without using MCP, we have to write custom integration for every single tool and data source. We have to put additional effort into that. With MCP we can make it easy. We don’t have to write custom integration for tools and data sources.\n\nMCP uses client-server architecture. There are few main things we should know.\n\nFor local communication, MCP uses stdio while using HTTP with Server-Sent events for remote communication. It uses JSON for message exchange.\n\nLet’s take a simple example. Assume you are using Claude Desktop, which serves as an MCP host application with an MCP client, and it connected to a MCP server. You ask for the weather forecast for tomorrow. Here is what happens:\n\nIn this blog, I am not going to talk about how to create our own MCP servers or MCP clients. If you are interested, you can refer these GitHub repos. There repos contain code for creating MCP server and MCP client.\n\nGitHub Links\n\nModel Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes tool and data integration for LLMs, much like how USB simplified device connectivity. By eliminating the need for custom integrations, MCP enhances interoperability and streamlines development. It also allows users to create their own MCP servers, enabling centralized management of multiple tools in one place.\n\n---------------------------\n\nStay Updated:- Follow Build Fast with AI pages for all the latest AI updates and resources.\n\nExperts predict 2025 will be the defining year for Gen AI Implementation.

    "publish_date": "January 24, 2025",
    "content": "## 1. AI Lacks Emotional Intelligence\n\n## 2. AI Can Only Work With Input Data\n\n## 3. AI’s Creative Process Is Limited to the Data It Receives\n\n## 4. AI Does Not Have Soft Skills\n\n## 5. Humans Make AI Work\n\n## 6. AI Is Meant to Complement Human Ability and Intelligence, Not Compete With It\n\n## 7. AI Needs to Be Fact-Checked\n\n## 8. AI Can't Perform Manual Labor\n\n## Learn to Work With AI, Not Fear It\n\n## Resources and Community\n\nAre you ready to let the future slip by, or will you grab your chance to define it?\n\nJoin Gen AI Launch Pad 2025 and take the lead.\n\nWhen faced with the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in today's labor market, employers probably think of automated processes that make work easier, faster, and more efficient. On the other hand, employees probably fear losing their jobs and being replaced by a machine.\n\nWhile AI is designed to replace manual labor with a more effective and quicker way of doing work, it cannot override the need for human input in the workspace. In this article, you will see why humans are still immensely valuable in the workplace and cannot be fully replaced by AI.\n\nEmotional intelligence is a key trait that keeps humans indispensable in the workplace, especially when interacting with clients.\n\nAs social beings, humans have an innate need for emotional connection. While AI can mimic intellectual processes, replicating emotional intelligence is far more challenging. Why? Because it demands empathy and a profound understanding of the human experience—qualities rooted in the ability to feel emotions like pain and suffering, which AI lacks.\n\nSavvy business leaders recognize the power of emotional connections in motivating staff and engaging clients. Machines simply can’t replicate this human touch. Fortunately, there are ways for individuals to sharpen their emotional intelligence and strengthen these connections.\n\nNo matter how sophisticated AI becomes, the emotional bond between humans and machines will likely remain limited. This makes human empathy and connection irreplaceable—especially in driving relationships and business growth.\n\nAI operates strictly within the boundaries of the data it’s given. When faced with tasks outside its programmed knowledge or unforeseen circumstances, it quickly reaches its limits. Machines simply aren’t designed to adapt beyond their algorithms, making them ineffective in unfamiliar scenarios.\n\nThis limitation is particularly evident in tech and manufacturing, where unexpected challenges frequently arise. While AI developers work tirelessly to create temporary fixes, the belief that AI can adapt to any situation is one of the many myths surrounding artificial intelligence.\n\nWorried that AI might replace your skills? Rest easy—it won’t. Human reasoning, creativity, improvisation, adaptability, and our unique ability to gather and process information are far beyond what AI can replicate. Your professional expertise remains safe in a world where human ingenuity is irreplaceable.\n\nWhen it comes to brainstorming and innovation, AI falls short. Since it can only process and work with existing data, it lacks the ability to devise new methods, styles, or patterns independently. AI remains confined to the templates it’s programmed to follow, unable to break free from its predefined boundaries.\n\nCreativity, on the other hand, is a cornerstone of any thriving workplace. It brings fresh, exciting ideas that break the monotony of repetitive tasks, where AI often excels. Creativity is also the driving force behind innovation, a quality machines can’t replicate.\n\nClosely tied to creativity is the ability to think outside the box. AI is designed to operate \"within the box,\" functioning strictly within the limits of its programmed data. Humans, however, excel at stepping outside those confines—sourcing information creatively, navigating ambiguity, and crafting solutions even when resources or data are limited.\n\nThis unique human ability to innovate and solve problems ensures that AI will never replace the essential role of people in the workplace. Creativity keeps humans indispensable.\n\nSoft skills are essential for every professional, no matter the role. These include teamwork, attention to detail, critical and creative thinking, effective communication, and interpersonal abilities. They’re in high demand across industries, and mastering them is a key step toward career success.\n\nFrom company executives to field workers, soft skills are universally valuable. They enhance collaboration, problem-solving, and adaptability, giving humans a clear advantage over AI in the workplace.\n\nMachines, however, can’t replicate soft skills. AI lacks the emotional intelligence and reasoning needed to develop traits like empathy, adaptability, or effective communication. These uniquely human abilities are critical for fostering workplace growth and building meaningful connections, making them a defining edge over artificial intelligence.\n\nArtificial intelligence wouldn’t exist without human intelligence. After all, humans design AI, write its code, input the data it processes, and ultimately operate these machines. AI’s foundation is entirely a product of human ingenuity.\n\nAs AI applications expand, the need for human expertise grows alongside them. Humans are essential for designing AI systems, building the machines, and managing their operation and maintenance. These tasks require skills and insights that only humans possess.\n\nWith this understanding, it’s clear that AI can’t override humans in the workplace. Instead, it will continue to rely on us for its development and functionality, reinforcing the irreplaceable value of human intelligence.\n\nArtificial intelligence is steadily reshaping the workplace, replacing many roles that involve repetitive tasks with minimal reasoning. However, as technology advances, it also creates new opportunities for humans in an increasingly tech-driven world.\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, AI could replace around 85 million jobs by 2025—but it will also generate approximately 97 million new roles. This shift highlights a crucial question: How can humans collaborate with AI rather than compete against it?\n\nIn today’s world, AI is becoming indispensable, but it remains rooted in human creativity and innovation. Forward-thinking organizations are already blending human expertise with AI capabilities to drive productivity and innovation. The focus should be on adapting to this new dynamic and exploring ways humans and AI can work together to shape the future.\n\nOne of the major drawbacks of AI chatbots, like ChatGPT, is their tendency to produce inaccuracies, often requiring human fact-checking. While AI learns quickly, it lacks common sense and the nuanced reasoning needed to verify or challenge facts effectively. For this reason, some queries are better directed elsewhere.\n\nThe key takeaway? Since AI cannot self-moderate, external oversight will always be necessary. This points to fact-checking becoming a prominent career path in the future. If you want to stay ahead of the curve, now might be the perfect time to refine your research and critical thinking skills.\n\nJobs like writer, programmer, accountant, and designer—roles heavily reliant on software—are increasingly susceptible to being partially handled by AI systems.\n\nIn contrast, blue-collar jobs, such as plumber, electrician, police officer, bricklayer, and construction worker, remain largely unaffected by AI. These roles require hands-on expertise and physical labor, which AI systems can’t replicate.\n\nSure, in the distant future, automated 3D printers might revolutionize home construction, but for now, blue-collar work is safe from AI's reach. In fact, as these roles maintain their irreplaceable value, they may even become more lucrative in the coming years.\n\nArtificial intelligence isn't something to be scared of. However, you must step up your game to not be replaced by AI. Upskill, stay abreast with the latest trends in your field, and be innovative and creative. This way, you will be an asset no employer would risk losing.\n\nSo the next time you hear how artificial intelligence threatens to eliminate humans from the workforce, refer to this article and rest assured that humans will always have the upper hand over AI.\n\n---------------------------\n\nStay Updated:- Follow Build Fast with AI pages for all the latest AI updates and resources.\n\nExperts predict 2025 will be the defining year for Gen AI Implementation.

This section shows how to combine Vanna.AI with Gemini.\n\nVanna.AI can be trained to better understand your database by feeding it SQL queries, DDL statements, and documentation about your data structure.\n\nNow that Vanna.AI has been set up and trained, you can ask it natural language questions and retrieve answers directly.\n\nVanna.AI offers an elegant solution for simplifying database queries through natural language. It provides powerful tools for integrating databases with AI, making it easier for non-technical users to interact with data, automate reporting, and create intelligent systems.\n\nBy setting up Vanna.AI with Flask, connecting it to a database, training it with real data, and utilizing the Gemini model for advanced NLP, you can unlock the full potential of Vanna.AI for your projects.\n\nNext, explore integrating this system with other web apps, experiment with more complex queries, or try it out on your own datasets to see how it can help streamline your data analysis.\n\n---------------------------\n\nStay Updated:- Follow Build Fast with AI pages for all the latest AI updates and resources.\n\nExperts predict 2025 will be the defining year for Gen AI implementation.Want to be ahead of the curve?\n\nJoin Build Fast with AI’s Gen AI Launch Pad 2025 - your accelerated path to mastering AI tools and building revolutionary applications.\n\n---------------------------\n\nJoin our community of 12,000+ AI enthusiasts and learn to build powerful AI applications! Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this tutorial will help you understand and implement AI agents in your projects.\n\n* Explanation:\n* vanna: This is the core package that provides the main functionality for translating natural language into SQL.\n* vanna[gemini]: The gemini extra dependency adds support for Google’s Gemini model, which enhances Vanna.AI’s natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. With Gemini, Vanna.AI can handle more complex queries and provide smarter responses.\n* Expected Output:\n* After running the command, you’ll see output from pip showing that the packages were installed successfully. It will look something like this:\n\n* Real-World Application:\n* Installing these dependencies is the first step toward integrating Vanna.AI into your environment. Once installed, you can start using it in your data workflows, whether it's for data analysis, generating reports, or powering automated data retrieval in apps.\n\n* Explanation:\n* The userdata.get function pulls the Google API key and Vanna.AI API key from the environment where the code is being executed. This ensures that the keys are securely stored and retrieved without hardcoding them into the script.\n* These keys are required for the system to access Google’s resources (for example, Google Gemini for NLP) and Vanna.AI’s services.\n* Expected Output:\n* There is no direct output here. However, once these keys are successfully retrieved, you’ll be able to connect to the APIs and use their features.\n* Real-World Application:\n* API keys are essential for managing access to cloud services and external platforms. This method ensures that only authorized users can interact with the system, securing sensitive data.\n\n* Explanation:\n* VannaDefault: This is a default class in the Vanna.AI library that connects to a specified model (in this case, ‘chinook’) and uses the provided API key for authentication.\n* connect_to_sqlite: This method connects Vanna.AI to a SQLite database hosted at the specified URL (Chinook.sqlite). The database contains various sales and artist data.\n* ask: The ask method takes a natural language query and sends it to Vanna.AI, which translates it into an appropriate SQL query. Here, the query is asking for the top 10 artists by sales.\n* VannaFlaskApp: This sets up a Flask application to make your Vanna.AI-powered database accessible via the web. Running VannaFlaskApp(vn).run() will start a local web server.\n* Expected Output:\n* The response will return the top 10 artists by sales, based on the database.\n* The Flask app will start running, and you can access it at http://localhost:5000 (or a similar address).\n* Example response to the query might look like:\n\n* Real-World Application:\n* Flask is a great tool for creating web-based interfaces for databases. By setting up Vanna.AI with Flask, you can create applications where users can query databases using natural language.\n* This is useful for creating dashboards, chatbots, or customer-facing tools that allow users to interact with data without knowing SQL.\n\n* Explanation:\n* This code defines a new class, MyVanna, that combines two classes: VannaDB_VectorStore for database interaction and GoogleGeminiChat for advanced natural language understanding.\n* The GoogleGeminiChat class is initialized with the Google API key and the Gemini model (gemini-2.0-flash-exp), which allows Vanna.AI to process more sophisticated language queries.\n* VannaDB_VectorStore connects Vanna.AI to your SQLite database, so you can retrieve information based on the data stored.\n* Expected Output:\n* This class is now configured to process advanced queries. While there’s no immediate output from this block, you’ll have a more powerful model ready to handle complex questions.\n* Real-World Application:\n* Combining Vanna.AI with Google Gemini allows for more nuanced understanding of natural language queries. This is particularly useful when dealing with complex datasets where a basic model might struggle with phrasing or context.\n\n* Explanation:\n* train(sql=...): This method allows you to train the model with a specific SQL query. It helps Vanna.AI learn how to execute similar queries in the future.\n* train(ddl=...): This is where you train Vanna.AI with Data Definition Language (DDL), which defines the structure of the database (e.g., creating tables).\n* train(documentation=...): This method adds documentation to help Vanna.AI understand what each table or field represents. In this case, it explains that the Artist table contains information about music artists.\n* Expected Output:\n* While no output is immediately shown, the model is now more \"intelligent\" and can process SQL queries, DDL, and documentation more accurately.\n* Real-World Application:\n* Training Vanna.AI is crucial when working with custom or complex databases. By providing it with relevant data, it becomes more efficient and accurate in understanding and querying your data.\n\n* Explanation:\n* The ask method sends a natural language query to Vanna.AI, which converts it into an SQL query and retrieves the relevant data from the database.\n* In this case, the query asks for the top 10 artists by sales, and the result will be printed out.\n* Expected Output:\n* The response will be a list of tuples representing the top 10 artists by sales, for example:\n\n* Real-World Application:\n* The ability to ask questions in natural language and receive database-driven responses is immensely valuable for non-technical users. Whether for customer support, business reporting, or even interactive dashboards, this functionality makes data much more accessible.\n\n* Vanna.AI GitHub Repository\n* Google Gemini Documentation\n* Flask Documentation\n* Vanna.AI Build Fast With AI Detailed Notebook\n\n* Website: www.buildfastwithai.com\n* LinkedIn: linkedin.com/company/build-fast-with-ai/\n* Instagram: instagram.com/buildfastwithai/\n* Twitter: x.com/satvikps\n* Telegram: t.me/BuildFastWithAI\n\n```\nvanna\n```\n\n```\nvanna[gemini]\n```\n\n```\ngemini\n```\n\n```\nuserdata.get\n```\n\n```\nVannaDefault\n```\n\n```\nconnect_to_sqlite\n```\n\n```\nChinook.sqlite\n```\n\n```\nask\n```\n\n```\nask\n```\n\n```\nVannaFlaskApp\n```\n\n```\nVannaFlaskApp(vn).run()\n```\n\n```\nhttp://localhost:5000\n```\n\n```\nMyVanna\n```\n\n```\nVannaDB_VectorStore\n```\n\n```\nGoogleGeminiChat\n```\n\n```\nGoogleGeminiChat\n```\n\n```\ngemini-2.0-flash-exp\n```\n\n```\nVannaDB_VectorStore\n```\n\n```\ntrain(sql=...)\n```\n\n```\ntrain(ddl=...)\n```\n\n```\ntrain(documentation=...)\n```\n\n```\nArtist\n```\n\n```\nask\n```\n\n"

Define the agent’s core instructions\n\n## Step 4. Define and optimize your core tools\n\n## Step 5. Decide on a memory handling strategy\n\n## Step 6. Parse the agent’s raw output\n\n## Step 7. Orchestrate the agent’s next step\n\n## Where do multi-agent systems come in?\n\n## Conclusion\n\n## References & Further Reading\n\n## Resources and Community\n\n### Let’s build a general-purpose LLM agent from scratch!\n\nAre you ready to let the future slip by, or will you grab your chance to define it?\n\nJoin Gen AI Launch Pad 2025 and take the lead.\n\nWhy build a general-purpose agent?\n\nBecause it’s an excellent tool to prototype your use cases and lays the groundwork for designing your own custom agentic architecture.\n\nBefore we dive in, let’s quickly introduce LLM agents. Feel free to skip ahead.\n\nAn LLM agent is a program whose execution logic is controlled by its underlying model.\n\nWhat sets an LLM agent apart from approaches like few-shot prompting or fixed workflows is its ability to define and adapt the steps required to execute a user’s query. Given access to a set of tools (like code execution or web search), the agent can decide which tool to use, how to use it, and iterate on results based on the output. This adaptability enables the system to handle diverse use cases with minimal configuration.\n\nAgentic architectures exist on a spectrum, ranging from the reliability of fixed workflows to the flexibility of autonomous agents. For instance, a fixed flow like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can be enhanced with a self-reflection loop, enabling the program to iterate when the initial response falls short. Alternatively, a ReAct agent can be equipped with fixed flows as tools, offering a flexible yet structured approach. The choice of architecture ultimately depends on the use case and the desired trade-off between reliability and flexibility.\n\nChoosing the right model is critical to achieving your desired performance. There are several factors to consider, like licensing, cost, and language support. The most important consideration for building an LLM agent is the model’s performance on key tasks like coding, tool calling, and reasoning. Benchmarks to evaluate include:\n\nAnother crucial factor is the model’s context window. Agentic workflows can eat up a lot of tokens — sometimes 100K or more — a larger context window is really helpful.\n\nModels to Consider (at the time of writing)\n\nIn general, larger models tend to offer better performance, but smaller models that can run locally are still a solid option. With smaller models, you’ll be limited to simpler use cases and might only be able to connect your agent to one or two basic tools.\n\nThe main difference between a simple LLM and an agent comes down to the system prompt.\n\nThe system prompt, in the context of an LLM, is a set of instructions and contextual information provided to the model before it engages with user queries.\n\nThe agentic behavior expected of the LLM can be codified within the system prompt.\n\nHere are some common agentic patterns, which can be customized to fit your needs:\n\nThe last two patterns — ReAct and Plan-then-Execute — are often the best starting point for building a general-purpose single agent.\n\nTo implement these behaviors effectively, you’ll need to do some prompt engineering. You might also want to use a structured generation technique. This basically means shaping the LLM’s output to match a specific format or schema, so the agent’s responses stay consistent with the communication style you’re aiming for.\n\nExample: Below is a system prompt excerpt for a ReAct style agent from the Bee Agent Framework.\n\nWe tend to take for granted that LLMs come with a bunch of features right out of the box. Some of these are great, but others might not be exactly what you need. To get the performance you’re after, it’s important to spell out all the features you want — and don’t want — in the system prompt.\n\nThis could include instructions like:\n\nExample: Below is a snippet of the instructions section from the Bee Agent Framework.\n\nTools are what give your agents their superpowers. With a narrow set of well-defined tools, you can achieve broad functionality. Key tools to include are code execution, web search, file reading, and data analysis.\n\nFor each tool, you’ll need to define the following and include it as part of the system prompt:\n\nExample: Below is an excerpt of an Arxiv tool implementation from Langchain Community. This implementation requires an ArxivAPIWrapper implementation.\n\nIn certain cases, you’ll need to optimize tools to get the performance you’re looking for. This might involve tweaking the tool name or description with some prompt engineering, setting up advanced configurations to handle common errors, or filtering the tool’s output.\n\nLLMs are limited by their context window — the number of tokens they can “remember” at a time. This memory can fill up fast with things like past interactions in multi-turn conversations, lengthy tool outputs, or extra context the agent is grounded on. That’s why having a solid memory handling strategy is crucial.\n\nMemory, in the context of an agent, refers to the system’s capability to store, recall, and utilize information from past interactions. This enables the agent to maintain context over time, improve its responses based on previous exchanges, and provide a more personalized experience.\n\nCommon Memory Handling Strategies:\n\nAdditionally, you can also have an LLM detect key moments to store in long-term memory. This allows the agent to “remember” important facts about the user, making the experience even more personalized.\n\nThe five steps we’ve covered so far lay the foundation for setting up an agent. But what happens if we run a user query through our LLM at this stage?\n\nHere’s an example of what that might look like:\n\nAt this point, the agent produces raw text output. So how do we get it to actually execute the next step? That’s where parsing and orchestration come in.\n\nA parser is a function that converts raw data into a format your application can understand and work with (like an object with properties)\n\nFor the agent we’re building, the parser needs to recognize the communication structure we defined in Step 2 and return a structured output, like JSON. This makes it easier for the application to process and execute the agent’s next steps.\n\nNote: some model providers like OpenAI, can return parsable outputs by default. For other models, especially open-source ones, this would need to be configured.\n\nThe final step is setting up the orchestration logic. This determines what happens after the LLM outputs a result. Depending on the output, you’ll either:\n\nIf a tool call is triggered, the tool’s output is sent back to the LLM (as part of its working memory). The LLM would then determine what to do with this new information: either perform another tool call or return an answer to the user.\n\nHere’s an example of how this orchestration logic might look in code:\n\nAnd voilà! You now have a system capable of handling a wide variety of use cases — from competitive analysis and advanced research to automating complex workflows.\n\nWhile this generation of LLMs is incredibly powerful, they have a key limitation: they struggle with information overload. Too much context or too many tools can overwhelm the model, leading to performance issues. A general-purpose single agent will eventually hit this ceiling, especially since agents are notoriously token-hungry.\n\nFor certain use cases, a multi-agent setup might make more sense. By dividing responsibilities across multiple agents, you can avoid overloading the context of a single LLM agent and improve overall efficiency.\n\nThat said, a general-purpose single-agent setup is a fantastic starting point for prototyping. It can help you quickly test your use case and identify where things start to break down. Through this process, you can:\n\nStarting with a single agent gives you valuable insights to refine your approach as you scale to more complex systems.\n\nBuilding a general-purpose LLM agent provides a solid foundation for developing custom AI solutions tailored to specific use cases. By carefully selecting the right LLM, defining control logic, structuring communication, and integrating optimized tools, you can create an adaptable and efficient agent. The balance between flexibility and reliability depends on your architecture choices, such as using ReAct or Plan-then-Execute patterns. Additionally, memory handling and tool optimization play crucial roles in enhancing the agent's performance. With continuous refinements and prompt engineering, you can build an LLM agent capable of handling diverse tasks with minimal human intervention.\n\nIf you want to dive deeper into LLM agents and agentic architectures, here are some valuable resources:\n\n---------------------------\n\nStay Updated:- Follow Build Fast with AI pages for all the latest AI updates and resources.\n\nExperts predict 2025 will be the defining year for Gen AI Implementation.

They remain secretive about their data sources, leaving AI training processes largely opaque and difficult to understand.\n\nUsers of the career networking website were surprised to learn in September that their data was potentially being used to train AI models. “At the end of the day, people want that edge in their careers, and what our gen-AI services do is help give them that assist,” says Eleanor Crum, a spokesperson for LinkedIn.\n\nPeople reveal all sorts of personal information while using a chatbot. OpenAI provides some options for what happens to what you say to ChatGPT — including allowing its future AI models not to be trained on the content. “We give users a number of easily accessible ways to control their data, including self-service tools to access, export, and delete personal information through ChatGPT. That includes easily accessible options to opt out from the use of their content to train models,” says Taya Christianson, an OpenAI spokesperson. (The options vary slightly depending on your account type, and data from enterprise customers is not used to train models).\n\nOpenAI also says if you have a “high volume” of images hosted online that you want removed from training data, then it may be “more efficient” to add GPTBot to the robots.txt file of the website where the images are hosted.\n\nTraditionally a website’s robots.txt file — a simple text file that usually sits at websitename.com/robots.txt — has been used to tell search engines, and others, whether they can include your pages in their results. It can now also be used to tell AI crawlers not to scrape what you have published — and AI companies have said they’ll honor this arrangement.\n\nFor users of Google’s chatbot, Gemini, conversations may sometimes be selected for human review to improve the AI model. Opting out is simple, though. Open up Gemini in your browser, click on Activity, and select the Turn Off drop-down menu. Here you can just turn off the Gemini Apps Activity, or you can opt out as well as delete your conversation data. While this does mean in most cases that future chats won’t be seen for human review, already selected data is not erased through this process. According to Google’s privacy hub for Gemini, these chats may stick around for three years.\n\n1. Open Gemini in Your Browser:\n\n2. Access the Activity Settings:\n\n3. Locate the Drop-Down Menu:\n\n4. Disable Gemini Apps Activity:\n\n5. Optional - Delete Conversation Data:\n\n6. Understand Limitations:\n\n7. Confirm Changes:\n\nFor more information, refer to the privacy section of the Gemini app.\n\nAll of those random Slack messages at work might be used by the company to train its models as well. “Slack has used machine learning in its product for many years. This includes platform-level machine-learning models for things like channel and emoji recommendations,” says Jackie Rocca, a vice president of product at Slack who’s focused on AI.\n\nEven though the company does not use customer data to train a large language model for its Slack AI product, Slack may use your interactions to improve the software’s machine-learning capabilities. This could include information like your messages, content, and files, says Slack’s privacy page.\n\nThe only real way to opt out is to have your administrator email Slack at feedback@slack.com. The message must have the subject line “Slack Global model opt-out request” and include your organization’s URL. Slack doesn’t provide a timeline for how long the opt-out process takes, but it should send you a confirmation email after it’s complete.\n\n1. Contact Your Slack Administrator:\n\n2.

Tokenization involves breaking down text into smaller, manageable pieces (tokens) that the model can understand and process. The efficiency and effectiveness of tokenization directly affect model performance and the costs associated with using these models.\n\nIn this blog post, we'll dive into Tiktoken, an open-source tokenizer developed by OpenAI that significantly improves the speed and accuracy of tokenization. Whether you’re a data scientist, software engineer, or AI enthusiast, understanding how to use Tiktoken will empower you to optimize text processing in your projects and unlock the full potential of OpenAI models.\n\nWe'll explore how Tiktoken works, walk through code examples, and explain how you can use it in real-world applications. Let’s get started!\n\nTokenization is the process of breaking down text into units, known as tokens, that a model can process. These tokens can represent words, characters, or even parts of words. Tokenization is essential because large models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 work with these tokens instead of raw text. Models are trained to predict the next token in a sequence, making tokenization a key step in natural language understanding.\n\nFor example, the sentence \"Tiktoken is amazing!\" might be broken down into tokens like:\n\nBut the way these tokens are represented internally (as numbers or byte sequences) can vary depending on the tokenizer being used.\n\nTiktoken is a high-performance library designed to efficiently tokenize text for OpenAI models. It’s optimized for speed and resource efficiency, which is crucial for large-scale applications or real-time processing.\n\nThe first step to using Tiktoken in your projects is to install it. If you’re using Google Colab or a similar environment, you can simply install Tiktoken using pip.\n\nAfter running the setup, the code should execute without any errors, confirming that Tiktoken is properly installed and functioning. If there were any issues, an error message would appear.\n\nThis setup is fundamental for using Tiktoken in real-world applications, such as preparing text for GPT-3 or GPT-4 model API calls. It's especially useful in scenarios where large datasets need to be preprocessed before being fed into the model, ensuring that tokenization is efficient and error-free.\n\nOnce you've installed Tiktoken, the next step is understanding how to encode and decode text. In this section, we’ll explore the core functionality of Tiktoken: tokenizing and detokenizing text.\n\nUnderstanding the encoding and decoding process is essential for applications that involve generating or analyzing text with large language models. For example, if you're building a chat application or a content generation tool, understanding tokenization helps you better manage token limits, optimize API usage, and ensure the output matches your expectations.\n\nTiktoken supports several different encoding schemes, each optimized for different model types. In this section, we’ll compare how different encodings handle the same text, helping you understand their behavior and choose the right one for your application.\n\nIn this function, we compare four different encodings using the string \"antidisestablishmentarianism\":\n\nFor each encoding, the function:\n\nThe output will vary depending on the encoding used. Here's a sample output for this string:\n\nChoosing the right encoding depends on the model you're using and the specific needs of your application. For example, if you're processing short texts like user messages in a chatbot, r50k_base might be sufficient. For longer, more complex texts, you might prefer a more detailed encoding like cl100k_base or o200k_base.\n\nFinally, we’ll explore how to count the tokens used in a set of messages. This is essential for managing API usage, as models like GPT-4 have token limits that determine how much text can be sent in a single request.\n\nThis function takes a list of messages and returns the total number of tokens used. It’s useful when interacting with the OpenAI API, where token usage is billed. Knowing how many tokens you’ve used helps you stay within API limits and manage costs effectively.\n\nThe function will return the number of tokens used by the provided set of messages.\n\nUnderstanding token usage is crucial for managing costs when using large models. If you're building a chatbot or virtual assistant, you can optimize interactions by keeping track of token usage and adjusting the conversation flow accordingly.\n\nIn this post, we’ve explored how Tiktoken streamlines the tokenization process for OpenAI models. From setting up the library and encoding/decoding text, to comparing different encodings and counting tokens for chat completions, Tiktoken provides a powerful toolkit for working with text in AI applications.\n\n---------------------------\n\nStay Updated:- Follow Build Fast with AI pages for all the latest AI updates and resources.\n\nExperts predict 2025 will be the defining year for Gen AI implementation.Want to be ahead of the curve?\n\nJoin Build Fast with AI’s Gen AI Launch Pad 2025 - your accelerated path to mastering AI tools and building revolutionary applications.\n\n---------------------------\n\nJoin our community of 12,000+ AI enthusiasts and learn to build powerful AI applications!

Enter FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) – an open-source library designed to perform similarity search and clustering for dense vectors at scale. FAISS is optimized for both CPU and GPU environments, making it ideal for large-scale, high-performance applications.\n\nThis blog will take you through a comprehensive exploration of FAISS, providing detailed explanations of its functionalities, sample code snippets, and real-world applications. By the end, you will have a strong grasp of how to implement FAISS for your vector search and clustering needs.\n\nTo begin, we need to install the required libraries. In this example, we are also using LangChain for embedding generation.\n\nThis setup is ideal for any application requiring semantic search, such as document retrieval, recommendation systems, or question answering systems.\n\nThe vector store is a fundamental component that holds your vector data and allows efficient similarity searches.\n\nThis structure is perfect for building vector databases for tasks like clustering customer reviews or searching through a large corpus of documents.\n\nAdding documents to the vector store involves embedding the text and assigning unique IDs to each document.\n\nThe documents are embedded and added to the vector store, ready for similarity search.\n\nThis step is essential when building searchable databases for social media analysis, news archives, or customer feedback systems.\n\nTo remove a document from the vector store, use the document's unique ID.\n\nDocument deletion is useful when maintaining a dynamic dataset, such as updating product catalogs or handling GDPR-related requests.\n\nFAISS allows us to perform a similarity search based on a query vector.\n\nThis feature is critical for building chatbots, Q&A systems, or search engines tailored to specific contexts or user preferences.\n\nYou can save the FAISS index for later use, ensuring persistence across sessions.\n\nSaving and loading indices is critical for production systems where indices are precomputed and reused.\n\nCombine multiple vector stores into a single unified store.\n\nMerging is valuable when consolidating datasets, such as combining data from different departments or sources.\n\nFAISS provides a robust, scalable solution for similarity search and clustering of dense vectors, with applications spanning search engines, recommendation systems, and beyond. Its integration with LangChain simplifies embedding generation, while its support for saving, loading, and merging indices makes it highly practical for real-world use cases.\n\n---------------------------\n\nStay Updated:- Follow Build Fast with AI pages for all the latest AI updates and resources.\n\nExperts predict 2025 will be the defining year for Gen AI Implementation.

LangGraph, a framework built on LangChain, facilitates the orchestration of multiple AI agents to work collaboratively in a graph-based workflow.\n\nThis blog post provides a detailed breakdown of how to implement a Multi-Agent Swarm using LangGraph. We will cover:\n\nBy the end of this guide, you’ll have a deep understanding of how to build a dynamic AI-driven swarm using LangGraph.\n\nA Multi-Agent Swarm involves multiple autonomous AI agents working together in a structured manner to complete tasks. Each agent specializes in a specific function, and their collaboration allows for efficient problem-solving.\n\nLangGraph facilitates this by enabling the creation of directed graphs where agents are interconnected based on task dependencies.\n\nTo begin, install the necessary dependencies:\n\nImport the required libraries:\n\nHere, OpenAI and ChatOpenAI power the language models, while Graph manages the multi-agent workflow.\n\nEach agent in the swarm has a specialized function. For instance, let’s define three agents:\n\nEach function processes the input and returns an appropriate response.\n\nWe define a LangGraph workflow where these agents operate sequentially:\n\nHere, the research_agent feeds data to the summarize_agent, which in turn sends output to the analysis_agent.\n\nWe initialize the workflow and execute it with an input query:\n\nThis confirms that the Multi-Agent Swarm is functioning as expected.\n\nFor independent tasks, agents can run in parallel. LangGraph allows multiple branches within a workflow.\n\nNow, both summarize_agent and analysis_agent will receive data simultaneously.\n\nTo enhance continuity, we can introduce memory so agents retain past interactions.\n\nThis enables agents to build on previous interactions dynamically.\n\nTo better understand the agent relationships, we can visualize the graph structure using networkx:\n\nThis visualization provides a clear representation of agent dependencies.\n\nLangGraph’s Multi-Agent Swarm has diverse applications, including:\n\nLangGraph provides a structured and efficient way to build multi-agent AI workflows.

Here’s how.\n\nJoin Build Fast with AI’s Gen AI Launch Pad 2025—a 6-week program designed to empower you with the tools and skills to lead in AI innovation.\n\nIn today’s AI-driven world, the ability to access and use external information efficiently has become increasingly important. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that combines the strength of information retrieval and language models to generate more contextually relevant answers. With the introduction of RAGLite, a robust, open-source framework, developers can integrate RAG capabilities seamlessly into their AI applications. This blog post will walk you through a detailed breakdown of RAGLite, its features, and how to implement it step-by-step, using various code blocks from the framework’s official notebook.\n\nWhether you're building a chatbot that requires real-time information or a search engine that needs precise document retrieval, this guide will give you the tools to get started with RAGLite effectively.\n\nBefore you dive into the core features of RAGLite, you’ll need to install the framework. The following command installs RAGLite via pip.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThis single line of code uses Python’s package manager pip to install the RAGLite library. By executing this command, you ensure that the necessary dependencies and components for the framework are installed, allowing you to begin using the advanced features RAGLite offers.\n\nExpected Output:\n\nOnce the command is executed successfully, you should see a confirmation message indicating that the package has been installed. For instance:\n\nReal-World Use Case:\n\nYou can use this installation step in any Python environment, like Jupyter Notebooks or Google Colab, to get started with RAGLite in just a few minutes.\n\nNext, let’s configure the framework by importing API keys, which are required to access certain services (like OpenAI models) through RAGLite.\n\nExplanation:\n\nHere, you're importing the necessary libraries to set environment variables for API keys. This code specifically imports the OpenAI API key, allowing you to access and use models such as GPT-4 in your retrieval-augmented generation tasks. The userdata.get('OPENAI_API_KEY') retrieves the key stored in your Google Colab environment.\n\nExpected Output:\n\nThere is no direct output, but this code sets the environment variable, enabling the API to work with OpenAI models in subsequent steps.\n\nReal-World Use Case:\n\nThis is essential when you need to interact with external services such as OpenAI’s GPT models, or any service that requires an API key for access. Make sure to store your keys securely.\n\nNow, you can configure the RAGLite framework by setting up parameters such as the database URL, language model (LLM), and document embedder.\n\nExplanation:\n\nHere, you're creating a configuration object that specifies how the retrieval and generation process should operate:\n\nExpected Output:\n\nThis code will not produce output but will prepare your configuration settings for future use. You can think of it as setting up the environment for a personalized RAG system.\n\nReal-World Use Case:\n\nThis setup is useful when you need to customize how your RAG model behaves by selecting a specific database and embedding model. For example, a large organization might use an extensive document database, while a smaller app might need only a simple SQLite configuration.\n\nRAGLite allows you to fine-tune how documents are ranked by introducing a reranking mechanism. In the next block of code, we set up a reranker for English documents.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThis code modifies the earlier configuration by adding a reranker. A reranker is a model that helps to order the retrieved documents in a way that improves the quality of results. The ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2 model is used here, which is optimized for tasks like ranking document relevance.\n\nExpected Output:\n\nAgain, no direct output is produced, but the configuration is now optimized for reranking retrieved documents before they are passed to the language model.\n\nReal-World Use Case:\n\nYou would use rerankers when you need to improve the precision of your document retrieval system. For example, in a research application, you may want to ensure that the most relevant papers are retrieved first.\n\nOnce your configuration is ready, you can download documents and insert them into the database.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThis code performs two actions:\n\nExpected Output:\n\nReal-World Use Case:\n\nThis is useful for knowledge-driven AI applications where documents or research papers need to be inserted and indexed for later retrieval. Imagine an academic research assistant bot that pulls relevant research papers for users.\n\nAdaptive RAG shows how to retrieve relevant information and adjust responses in real-time based on retrieved context.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThis block demonstrates adaptive retrieval-augmented generation. It starts with a user question (\"How is intelligence measured?\"), retrieves relevant documents, and generates a response based on the retrieved context. The retrieved documents are stored in chunk_spans.\n\nExpected Output:\n\nYou will see streaming outputs from the rag function as it fetches and processes the documents, followed by the relevant document content.\n\nReal-World Use Case:\n\nAdaptive RAG is particularly useful for real-time applications like chatbots or question-answering systems, where dynamic information retrieval is essential for delivering accurate and up-to-date answers.\n\nThe final example shows how to create instructions based on user queries and retrieved context, leading to more programmable and customizable RAG solutions.\n\nExplanation:\n\nHere, the code first retrieves relevant document chunks using a query and the configuration. Then, it creates a RAG instruction, which instructs the model to consider the retrieved context when generating a response.\n\nExpected Output:\n\nThe output will be a series of responses generated based on the user query and the relevant document chunks.\n\nReal-World Use Case:\n\nThis is ideal for building complex, highly interactive systems where users can ask nuanced questions and the system responds based on a mix of user input and a broad knowledge base.\n\nRAGLite is a game-changer for developers aiming to leverage the power of retrieval-augmented generation in their AI applications. By using this framework, you can easily integrate retrieval and generation, fine-tune the ranking of your document retrievals, and generate highly relevant content in real-time. This guide has covered the essential steps for setting up and configuring RAGLite, from installation to retrieving and generating contextual responses.\n\n---------------------------\n\nStay Updated:- Follow Build Fast with AI pages for all the latest AI updates and resources.\n\nExperts predict 2025 will be the defining year for Gen AI implementation.Want to be ahead of the curve?\n\nJoin Build Fast with AI’s Gen AI Launch Pad 2025 - your accelerated path to mastering AI tools and building revolutionary applications.\n\n---------------------------\n\nJoin our community of 12,000+ AI enthusiasts and learn to build powerful AI applications!

Learn to create AI-driven trading strategies and take control of your financial future.\n\nREGISTRATION LINK - Analyzing the Stock Market with AI\n\nIn today's data-driven financial landscape, the ability to analyze stock market trends efficiently can mean the difference between profitable investments and missed opportunities. The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and powerful programming tools has revolutionized how investors approach stock market analysis.\n\nPython has emerged as the leading programming language for financial analytics due to its simplicity, versatility, and robust libraries designed specifically for data analysis and machine learning. When combined with AI capabilities, Python becomes an even more powerful ally for both novice and experienced investors.\n\nGoogle Colab, a free cloud-based platform that allows you to write and execute Python code through your browser, has recently integrated AI features that make stock market analysis more accessible than ever before. This eliminates the need for complex local setups or expensive software subscriptions, democratizing financial analysis tools for everyone.\n\nIn this comprehensive guide, we'll explore five practical use cases that demonstrate how you can leverage AI, Python, and Google Colab to gain valuable insights into stock performance, predict market trends, and optimize investment strategies—all without writing a single line of code yourself.\n\nAnalyzing the stock performance of Tesla can provide insights into its past performance and potential future trends.\n\nHere's how you can retrieve and analyze Tesla's stock data with minimal effort:\n\nFinally, use the icon on the top right called \"Add Code Cell\" to insert the code into your notebook.\n\nThe code proposed by Gemini will appear in the left side and you just need to click the play button to \"run the cell\".\n\nThis simple process gives you immediate access to Tesla's historical stock data, visualized trends, and basic statistical insights without requiring you to know Python syntax or stock analysis methods.\n\nA moving average is a fundamental technical analysis tool that smooths out price fluctuations by creating a constantly updated average price. This helps identify the direction of trends and potential support/resistance levels.\n\nFollow these steps to calculate and visualize a moving average for any stock:\n\nWhen you run the code, you'll see something like this:\n\nThe visualization typically shows the actual stock price in one color and the smoothed moving average line in another color. This comparison helps identify potential buying or selling signals when the price crosses above or below the moving average line.\n\nMachine learning models can analyze historical stock data to identify patterns and make predictions about future price movements. While no prediction model is perfect, these tools can provide valuable insights to inform investment decisions.\n\nHere's how to implement a simple machine learning model for stock price prediction:\n\nHere's the complete code you can use:\n\nThe output will look something like this:\n\nThis visualization shows how closely the predicted prices match the actual prices. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) value gives you a quantitative measure of the model's accuracy—lower values indicate better predictions.\n\nHow It Works:\n\nNews and social media content can significantly impact stock prices. Sentiment analysis uses natural language processing (NLP) to determine whether news articles about a company are positive, negative, or neutral, providing insights into market sentiment that might affect stock performance.\n\nYou can implement sentiment analysis with this code:\n\nKey Benefits of Sentiment Analysis:\n\nThe sentiment scores range from -1 (extremely negative) to +1 (extremely positive), with 0 representing neutral sentiment. By tracking sentiment over time, you can spot trends in public perception that might precede stock price movements.\n\nPortfolio optimization uses mathematical techniques to find the optimal allocation of investments that maximizes returns while minimizing risk. This advanced technique helps investors make data-driven decisions about asset allocation.\n\nHere's a sample code for portfolio optimization:\n\nThe output provides a table showing the optimal allocation of your investment across different assets:\n\nHow Portfolio Optimization Works:\n\nFor real-world application, you would replace the dummy data with actual historical returns and calculated covariance of the assets in your portfolio.\n\nThe integration of AI capabilities into Google Colab has transformed stock market analysis, making sophisticated financial tools accessible to investors of all experience levels. By leveraging these AI-powered techniques, you can now perform complex analyses that previously required extensive programming knowledge or expensive financial software.\n\nThe five use cases we've explored—basic stock analysis, moving averages, machine learning predictions, sentiment analysis, and portfolio optimization—represent just the beginning of what's possible. As AI technology continues to advance, we can expect even more powerful and intuitive tools to emerge, further democratizing access to financial analytics.\n\nRemember that while these tools provide valuable insights, they should complement rather than replace fundamental research and financial knowledge. The most successful investors combine technical analysis with a deep understanding of the companies they invest in and the broader market context.\n\nWhether you're a casual investor looking to better understand market trends or a financial professional seeking to enhance your analytical toolkit, Google Colab's AI-powered environment offers a flexible, powerful platform for stock market analysis that grows with your needs and adapts to your investment strategy.\n\n---------------------------\n\nStay Updated:- Follow Build Fast with AI pages for all the latest AI updates and resources.\n\nExperts predict 2025 will be the defining year for Gen AI Implementation.

Join Gen AI Launch Pad 2024 and turn your curiosity into capability before the AI wave leaves you behind. 🚀\"\n\nAs AI models like GPT become more powerful and flexible, developers are often faced with a challenge: how do we get structured outputs from large language models (LLMs)? Enter Instructor, a library designed to simplify structured data extraction from LLMs. In this blog post, we'll explore what makes Instructor so effective, break down the code, and understand how you can integrate it with models like OpenAI's GPT and Cohere's models.\n\nInstructor makes it easy to prompt LLMs for structured outputs, such as JSON data. Instead of receiving unstructured text, you can request LLMs to provide responses in the format you need. This is especially useful for:\n\nInstructor abstracts away complexity, enabling you to build robust applications faster. By specifying a schema for the output, you ensure your AI delivers exactly what you need.\n\nFirst, let's install the necessary libraries. The notebook starts with a simple installation step:\n\nOutput:\n\nThis installs all necessary packages quietly (without verbose output).\n\nNext, you need API keys for OpenAI and Cohere. The code fetches these from Google Colab's userdata storage:\n\n1.OpenAI API Key:\n\n2.Cohere API Key:\n\nNow, let's import the required libraries:\n\nPydantic is a powerful data validation and parsing library in Python. It allows you to define schemas (structured models) for your data using Python classes. These schemas ensure that data conforms to the expected format and type, providing a reliable way to validate incoming data and prevent errors. Pydantic is particularly useful when you need to ensure consistency and correctness of data in applications.\n\nHere's an example of a simple pydantic model:\n\nIf you provide incorrect data types, Pydantic will raise a validation error:\n\nOutput:\n\nWhen combined with Instructor, Pydantic helps define the structure of the data you expect from an LLM. This means you can:\n\nInstructor uses Pydantic models to guide the LLM in generating consistent, structured outputs, making your applications more reliable and easier to maintain.\n\nHere's an example of how to define a structured output using pydantic and Instructor:\n\nIn this example:\n\nThis model tells the LLM to output responses matching this structure.\n\nInstructor can gracefully handle errors when the model output doesn't match the expected structure. If the LLM returns an output that doesn't align with the defined pydantic model, Instructor raises a validation error.\n\nThis helps ensure your application can handle unexpected outputs gracefully.\n\nThe Instructor library is a powerful tool for extracting structured data from large language models like OpenAI's GPT and Cohere's models. By combining the flexibility of LLMs with the precision of pydantic schemas, Instructor allows you to build applications that require consistent, structured outputs with ease.\n\nWhether you're building chatbots, automating data pipelines, or working on enterprise AI solutions, Instructor can help streamline your development process.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nStay Updated:- Follow Build Fast with AI pages for all the latest AI updates and resources.\n\nExperts predict 2025 will be the defining year for Gen AI implementation.Want to be ahead of the curve?\n\nJoin Build Fast with AI’s Gen AI Launch Pad 2025 - your accelerated path to mastering AI tools and building revolutionary applications.\n\n* Form Data Extraction: Automating extraction of specific fields from documents.\n* APIs & Automation: Structuring data for APIs or downstream processing.\n* Enterprise Use-Cases: Tasks that require predictable and structured results.\n* Data Pipelines: When you need clean, structured data for analytics or reporting.\n* Chatbots and Assistants: Ensuring responses from AI assistants follow a predictable format.\n\n* Instructor: The main library for structured outputs.\n* OpenAI: For accessing OpenAI models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.\n* Cohere: An alternative to OpenAI, providing different LLM capabilities.\n\n* Network Issues: If the installation is slow or fails, check your internet connection.\n* Version Conflicts: If you have older versions of libraries installed, update them using pip install --upgrade.\n* Environment Issues: Ensure you're working in a clean virtual environment or Colab instance to avoid conflicts.\n\n* Sign up at OpenAI.\n* Go to your account settings and generate a new API key.\n\n* Sign up at Cohere.\n* Navigate to the API section and generate a new API key.\n\n* Never share your API keys publicly or commit them to repositories.\n* Use environment variables or secure storage options to manage keys.\n\n* Instructor: The core library for handling structured outputs.\n* OpenAI: For interfacing with OpenAI's models.\n* Pydantic: For defining structured data models.\n\n* Enforce Data Integrity: Ensure the LLM’s response conforms to your schema.\n* Reduce Errors: Identify and handle invalid outputs gracefully.\n* Streamline Processing: Easily integrate structured outputs into your workflows, APIs, and data pipelines.\n\n* WeatherResponse: A pydantic model specifying the desired fields:\n* location: Name of the location (string).\n* temperature: The temperature in degrees (float).\n* condition: The weather condition (string).\n\n* Consistency: Ensures the LLM output follows a predictable structure.\n* Error Reduction: Reduces the chances of unexpected or unusable data.\n* Easier Parsing: Simplifies downstream processing and integration with APIs or databases.\n\n* Instructor GitHub Repository: Instructor on GitHub\n* OpenAI API Documentation: OpenAI Docs\n* Cohere API Documentation: Cohere Docs\n* Pydantic Documentation: Pydantic Docs\n* Instructor Build Fast with AI: NoteBook\n\n1.

The LLM remains unrivaled in performance, reasoning skills, and fine-tuning ease. The flagship model so far is the GPT-4o, which has a smaller, faster, and cheaper version called the GPT-4o mini.\n\nOpenAI recently launched the o1 and o1-mini models in beta, focusing on deeper reasoning and complex tasks in science, coding, and math. However, GPT-4o remains more capable for common use cases, as the o1 models lack features like Internet browsing.\n\nBesides LLMs, Open AI represents image models DALL-E and audio models Whisper and TTS. To know more about how they work, read our article on AI image generators and another one explaining sound, music and voice generation.\n\nGPT-4o is estimated to have hundreds of billions of parameters; some sources claim 1.8 trillion, although exact details are proprietary. In both versions, the context window can hold up to 128,000 tokens, which is the equivalent of 300 pages of text.\n\nGPT models are only available as a service in the cloud; you can’t deploy them on-premises. They are accessible via Open AI APIs, using Python, Node.js, and .Net. or through Azure OpenAI Service, which also supports C#, Go, and Java. You can call API with other languages as well, thanks to community libraries.\n\nBelow, we’ll list API products offered directly by Open AI.\n\nChat completions API allows you to quickly embed text generation capabilities into your app, chatbot, or other conversational interface.\n\nGenerating prose using Python with the chat completions endpoint. Source: OpenAI Platform\n\nTo customize GPT-4o/GPT-4o mini models, you have to prepare a dataset that contains at least 10 conversational patterns, though the OpenAI recommendation is to start with 50 training examples. The dataset for fine-tuning must be in JSON format and up to 1GB in size (though you don’t need a set that large to see improvements.) It can also contain images. To upload the dataset, use Files API or Uploads API for files larger than 512 MB.\n\nFine-tuning can be performed via OpenAI UI or programmatically, using OpenAI SDK. Azure OpenAI currently supports only text-to-text fine-tuning.\n\nGPT-4o API usage for business costs $2.5 /1M input tokens and $10/1M output tokens, while GPT-4o mini is much cheaper: $0.15/1M input tokens and $0.6/1M output tokens.\n\nO1-preview costs $15.00/1M input tokens and $60.00/1M output tokens.\n\nYou can find the detailed pricing information here.\n\nThe Gemini (former Bard) model family is optimized for high-level reasoning and understanding not only texts but also image, video, and audio data.\n\nThe model's name was inspired by NASA's early moonshot program, breakthrough Project Gemini. It was also associated with the Gemini astrology sign since people born under it are highly adaptable, effortlessly connect with diverse individuals, and naturally view situations from multiple perspectives.\n\nThe flagship products are Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash. Flash is a mid-size multimodal model optimized for a wide range of reasoning tasks. Pro can handle large amounts of data. Both models support over 100 languages.\n\nEstimates suggest Gemini models operates with 1.56 trillion parameters. Gemini 1.5 Pro has an unprecedented context window of two million tokens, which allows it to fit 10 Harry Potter novels (well, existing seven plus fan-dreamed three) in one prompt. Or one Harry Potter movie (2 hours of video) or 19 hours of audio. The Gemini 1.5 Flash’s context window is one million tokens.\n\nGemini models are cloud-based only. Google provides two ways to access its LLMs — Google AI and Vertex AI (Google’s end-to-end AI development platform). Both APIs support function calling.\n\nGoogle AI Gemini API ****provides a fast way to explore the LLM capabilities and get started with prototyping and creating simple chatbots. It supports mobile devices and natively connects with Firebase, a Google platform for the development of AI-powered web, iOS, and Android apps. The API can be consumed with Python, Node.js, and Go. SDKs for Flutter, Android, Swift, and JavaScript are recommended for prototyping only. If you want to launch your app written in those languages to production, migrate to Vertex AI.\n\nVertex AI Gemini API ****allows for building complex, enterprise-grade applications. With Vertex AI, you can leverage a range of additional services, such as MLOps tools for model validation, versioning, and monitoring, an Agent Building console for creating virtual assistants, and security features, critical for the production environment.\n\nOverall, it makes sense to start building your Gemini-based app with Google AI API and, as your project matures, move to Vertex AI API.\n\nWith Google AI, fine-tuning is possible for 1.5 Flash and text only. It doesn’t cover chat-style conversations. You can start with a dataset of 20 examples (each no longer than 40,000 characters), but the optimal size is between 100 and 500 examples. Tuned models don’t support JSON inputs and texts longer than 40,000 characters.\n\nVertex AI supports supervised fine-tuning for 1.5 Flash and Pro using text, image, audio, and document inputs. A dataset of 100 examples (up to 32,000 tokens each) is recommended. Fine-tuning can be done via the Gemini REST API, Google Cloud console, Vertex AI SDK for Python, or Colab Enterprise.\n\nRates vary based on the model, input type, and prompt size (inputs/outputs over 128k tokens cost twice as much). Text input/output is counted in million tokens or thousand characters (Vertex AI), audio and video inputs—in seconds, and visual inputs—in images.\n\nGoogle AI Gemini API offers a free tier for testing purposes with limitations of 15 requests/minute, 1500 requests/day, and 1M tokens per minute. Vertex AI provides batch mode with a 50 percent discount.\n\nMore details are available on the Google Cloud pricing page.\n\nLlama (short for Large Language Model Meta AI) is a family of open-source, highly customizable language models. The latest release, Llama 3.2, has two collections of models:\n\nAll versions work with eight languages: English, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Spanish, and Thai.\n\nBe aware that the EU’s AI Act, which will go into effect in the summer of 2025, сreates regulatory complexity for open-source AI. Llama 3.2 is currently [restricted from the European market](https://slator.com/meta-rolls-out-multimodal-llama-3-2-but-not-in-europe/#:~:text=Not Available in Europe,to concerns over GDPR compliance.) due to concerns about GDPR compliance.\n\nLlama 3.2 offers 1B, 3B, 11B, and 90B parameter models, all with a 128,000-token context length. The 11B and 90B models include vision capabilities for image analysis, graph interpretation, and geographical queries.\n\nLlama can be deployed on-premises, which gives companies control over data security and privacy. The models are available for download on llama.com and Hugging Face.\n\nIn September 2024, Meta presented the Llama Stack, the company’s first framework for efficiently deploying Llama models across various environments: on-premises, in cloud, and on local devices.\n\nIt contains a set of APIs, such as\n\nClient SDKs for working Llama Stack include Python, Node, Swift, and Kotlin, among others.\n\nAlso, companies can access Llama on multiple partner platforms, such as AWS (via Amazon Bedrock, a service that offers a choice of models via a single API), Databricks, Dell, Google Cloud, Grok, IBM, Intel, Microsoft Azure, NVIDIA, Oracle Cloud, Snowflake, and more.\n\nYou can customize your Llama model using different environments. Below are several options.\n\nLearn more about Llama fine-tuning from the official documentation here.\n\nLlama is open-source but still governed by a license that restricts its use in certain cases. Businesses with over 700 million active users monthly must contact Meta for special licensing. Downloading Llama is free. However, to utilize it as a service, you’ll have to pay the chosen cloud provider or API platform, and the price will depend on many factors and additional features offered by the vendor.\n\nFor example, Amazon Bedrock’s pricing depends on the region: North America is split into two price zones, Europe into three. In the US East zone, the framework charges for integration Llama 3.2 1B $0.1/M input or output tokens; Llama 3.2 90B—$2/M input or output tokens.\n\nThe Llama 3.2 1B price on the Grok platform is four times higher: $0.4/M input or output tokens.\n\nClaude is a family of models that can process text, code, and image input and generate code and text. The last generation includes two state-of-the-art models: the flagship Claude 3.5 Sonnet, specializing in complex tasks, coding, and creative writing, and the smaller and faster Claude 3.5 Haiku. The most powerful model of the previous generation is Claude 3 Opus, good in math and coding. The models support 10+ languages.\n\nClaude emphasizes ethics, guided by a Constitutional AI manifesto rooted in universal human values. Recently, it introduced a beta feature for computer use, enabling the model to interact with software and perform tasks like filling forms using data from your PC and the Internet.\n\nThe parameters are undisclosed, though they are rumored to be about 500 billion. The context window is 200k+ tokens (500 pages of text or 100 images) for all Claude 3.5 versions.\n\nThe model is cloud-hosted only. There are three first-party Anthropic APIs:\n\nYou can call APIs directly or use Python SDK and TypeScript SDK.\n\nClaude 3.5 and Claude 3 families are also available through Amazon Bedrock API and Vertex AI API.\n\nAnthropic’s strict information security requirements were a stumbling block when it came to model customization since the tuning data is user-controlled. So far, fine-tuning is only possible for Claude 3 Haiku in Amazon Bedrock.\n\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet usage costs $3/M input tokens and $15/M output tokens; Claude 3.5 Haiku is $0.25/M input tokens and $1.25/M output tokens. The Batches API provides a 50 percent discount. The detailed pricing info is here.\n\nGrok, an Elon Musk's brainchild, is integrated with X (formerly Twitter) and incorporates information from posts and comments in X into its answers. Grok-1 is open-source; you can download the code from GitHub.\n\nThe latest Grok family generation includes the commercial Grok-2. The Grok-2 mini is to be released soon. Currently, only the Beta version is accessible on the xAI console.\n\nThe website claims X Grok 2 Beta AI supports many languages, but their number is undisclosed. Obviously, the model can speak English.\n\nGrok, coined by Robert A. Heinlein, means deep understanding. While strong in coding and math, Grok lacks safety measures, making it easier to manipulate into harmful responses. It’s not ideal for customer service applications.\n\nThere are 314 billion parameters declared for Grok-1, and it has an 8.000-length context window. Parameters for Grok-2 are unknown so far, but the Grok beta version, which belongs to the Grok-2 family, has a 128-length context window.\n\nGrok-2 is multimodal. The model can generate high-resolution images on the X social network and understand input images, even explaining the meaning of a meme. However, it’s not publicly available yet.\n\nGrok-1 can be downloaded and deployed on-premises.\n\nIn the beginning, Grok was used only by the X platform and by premium users of X as a chatbot. However, in October 2024, Grok presented its first REST API service for enterprises, currently in the public beta testing phase. The API is accessible via xAI Console, which provides tools to create API keys, manage teams, handle billing, compare models, track usage, and access API documentation.\n\nCurrently, only the Grok-beta model—offering comparable performance to Grok 2 with enhanced efficiency, speed, and capabilities—is accessible via API on the console.\n\nThe xAI API integrates fully and is available through both the OpenAI SDK and the Anthropic SDK. Once you update the base URL, you can use the SDKs to call the Grok models with your xAI API key.\n\nThough downloadable, Grok-1 model cannot be fine-tuned.\n\nGrok-beta costs $5/M input tokens and $15/M output tokens. You can download the earlier version, Grok-1, for free.\n\nFounded in 2024, Mistral AI is a French startup co-founded by former Meta employees Timothée Lacroix and Guillaume Lample, together with former DeepMind researcher Arthur Mensch. The company offers a mix of open-source and commercial generative models.\n\nThe premium range includes six LLMs, such as Mistral Large 2 for complex tasks, Codestral for AI coding, and fast models like 3B and 8B. Mistral Large 2 is free for non-commercial research.\n\nSeven free models are also available, including Mathstral 7B and multilingual Mistral NeMo. Most Mistral models support five major European languages, while Mistral NeMo supports eleven, and Mistral Large 2 covers dozens of languages and 80+ coding languages.\n\nMistral Large 2 operates with 123 billion parameters.\n\nMistral Large 2, Mistral 3B, and 8B have a context window of 128,000 tokens.\n\nFirst, you can access any model on La Plateforme, a developer platform hosted on Mistral’s infrastructure, and pay-as-you-go for commercial use.\n\nOpen-source models can be downloaded from Hugging Face and used on your device or in your private cloud infrastructure, but you’ll have to buy a commercial license (to get the price list, connect with the team at the Mistral AI website). They are also accessible via cloud partners GCP, AWS, Azure, IBM, Snowflake, NVIDIA, and OUTSCALE, with a pay-as-you-go pricing model.\n\nMistral Large 2 is available on Azure AI Studio, AWS Bedrock, Google Cloud Model Garden, IBM watsonx, and Snowflake.\n\nMistral AI API includes a list of APIs dedicated to specific tasks: Chat Completion API for generating responses, Embeddings API for vectorizing or representing words as vectors (necessary for text classification, sentiment analysis, and more), Files API for uploading files that can be used in various endpoints, etc.\n\nAll models are open to experiments and customization. You can use a dedicated fine-tuning API at La Plateforme to create the fine-tuning pipeline. An open-source codebase on GitHub can be customized, too.\n\nMistral Large 2 costs $2/1M for input tokens and $6/1M for output tokens. A recent price cut makes it one of the most cost-effective frontier models. Ministral 3B is $0.04/1M for input/output tokens.\n\nFollow Build Fast with AI pages for all the latest AI updates and resources.\n\nWhy should 2025 be your year to master LLM APIs?\n\nBecause our Generative AI Mastery Program will take you from API calls to production-ready AI apps in just 6 weeks\n\nDon't just call APIs. Master them.\n\n* Lightweight (1B and 3 B)—text-only, 2-3 times faster than their bigger counterparts, and ideal for on-device and edge deployment; and\n* Vision (11B and 90B)—support image inputs and excel on image understanding.\n\n* Inference API for generating responses and processing complex inputs;\n* Safety API to moderate outputs for avoiding harmful or biased content;\n* Memory API that allows models to retain and reference past conversations, which is useful in customer support chatbots;\n* Agentic System API for function calling; and more.\n\n* Hugging Face with Axolotl library allows you to fine-tune all Llama 3.2 versions;\n* PyTorch native library torchtune supports the end-to-end fine-tuning lifecycle for Llama 3.2 (1,3 and 11B only);\n* Azure AI Studio offers fine-tuning for Llama 3.2 1B and 3B; other versions are coming soon; and\n* Amazon Bedrock supports customizing Llama 3.1 models but not the later generation.\n\n* Text Completions API is a legacy API, that won't be supported in the future.\n* Messages API is the new main API, and transferring from Text Completion to Message API is recommended. It can be used for either single queries or stateless multi-turn conversations.\n* Message Batches API (in beta mode) can process multiple Messages API requests simultaneously, costing 50 percent less than streaming API.\n\n"

The hybrid part means the model works both as a reasoning model and a large language model (LLM).\n\nWhile OpenAI recently announced that GPT-5 will be a unified model, Anthropic has already introduced Claude 3.7 Sonnet, which is capable of both quick responses and deeper reasoning, getting ahead in this particular approach to AI development.\n\nThis new model can \"think\" about questions for as long as the users ask it to, so depending on how long it considers things, its responses could be very different.\n\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet can also build complex apps with a single prompt, and with the introduction of a new product called Claude Code, developers can now give substantial engineering tasks to Claude directly from their terminal.\n\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet brings several important features that set it apart from previous models and other AI systems on the market:\n\nPerhaps the most notable feature is the extended thinking capability. Unlike most AI models that give instant responses, Claude 3.7 Sonnet can take time to \"think\" before answering questions. This thinking process is visible to users, making the AI's reasoning more transparent.\n\nWhen using the API, users can control exactly how much thinking the model does. You can tell Claude to think for a specific number of tokens, up to its output limit of 128K tokens. This allows you to balance speed and cost against the quality of answers.\n\nHere's an example Typescript code for extended thinking:\n\nThe API response will include both thinking and text content blocks:\n\nFor people who need higher accuracy, especially on complex topics like math, physics, or coding, the extended thinking mode makes a big difference. The model can work through problems step by step, similar to how humans think, which leads to more reliable answers.\n\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet supports up to 128K output tokens (in beta), which is over 15 times longer than before. This is very useful for:\n\nThis expanded capacity means the model can handle much more complex tasks without running into token limits.\n\nAs a developer, this is what I am most excited about. The model shows major improvements in coding across many areas:\n\nSeveral tech companies like Cursor, Cognition, Vercel, and Replit have already tested Claude 3.7 Sonnet and found it performs better than other models for real-world coding tasks.\n\nAccording to Anthropic, Claude 3.7 Sonnet makes more careful distinctions between harmful and harmless requests, reducing unnecessary refusals by 45% compared to earlier models. This helps the AI be more helpful without constantly blocking reasonable requests.\n\nThis is huge because one of the reasons that I have used Claude less and less in the past couple of months is the high frequency of refusals. It was an annoying feature to be honest.\n\nClaude Code is a brand new command line tool for what Anthropic calls \"agentic coding.\" Currently available as a limited research preview, it allows developers to give substantial engineering tasks to Claude directly from their terminal.\n\nThe tool acts as a coding partner that can:\n\nIn early testing, they found Claude Code could complete tasks in a single pass that would normally take 45+ minutes of manual work, cutting down development time.\n\nClaude Code is currently available as a limited research preview. Developers interested in trying it would need to join the preview program.\n\nThe performance of Claude 3.7 Sonnet shows significant improvements over previous models in several key areas:\n\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet has shown impressive results on coding benchmarks and real-world tests. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on SWE-bench Verified, which evaluates AI models' ability to solve real-world software issues.\n\nAnthropic also shared how Claude 3.7 Sonnet achieves state-of-the-art performance on TAU-bench, a framework that tests AI agents on complex real-world tasks with user and tool interactions.\n\nThe company says their goal with Claude Code is to better understand how developers use Claude for coding, which will help them make future model improvements.\n\nThe extended thinking mode makes Claude 3.7 Sonnet much better at tasks that need careful reasoning:\n\nThis reasoning capability puts Claude 3.7 Sonnet in a new category of AI models that can think more deeply about problems rather than just generating text based on patterns.\n\nThis one had me particularly excited.\n\nClaude Code is a command -line tool Anthropic introduced that basically lets you interact with Claude 3.7 through your terminal for coding tasks​.\n\nIn other words, Claude can now act like a developer's assistant who can edit files, run tests, debug code and even commit to GitHub — all via CLI commands you give it.\n\nImagine saying\n\n\"Hey Claude, open my app.js and optimize the search function\"\n\nand it just does it.\n\nOr asking Claude to run your test suite and fix any failing tests it finds. It's like having a super-intelligent junior developer who never gets tired.\n\nI tried a simple scenario where, I let Claude Code suggest a refactor in one of my Python scripts and it not only provided the updated code but actually executed it to verify it worked (under my supervision, of course).\n\nI have used the windsurf and they now added this claude 3.7 model for paid user.\n\nIt feels a bit like sci-fi to have an AI directly manipulating code on my machine.\n\nDo note, Claude Code is in limited preview right now​ but not everyone has access yet — and it works under human oversight (thankfully!).\n\nSo you still have to review and approve its changes (no skynet scenarios… yet).\n\nBut as a glimpse of the future of AI-assisted development it's incredibly promising.\n\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet is now available on both the Claude website and through API access. To access it via a chat interface, you can try the following channels:\n\nSimply switch to Claude 3.7 Sonnet from the model dropdown.\n\nAll Claude plans can access the model, including Free, Pro, Team, and Enterprise. However, the extended thinking mode is only available for paid plans (Pro, Team, and Enterprise).\n\nDevelopers can also access Claude 3.7 Sonnet through:\n\nWhen using the API, developers have full control over the model's thinking budget, allowing them to specify how many tokens the model can use for thinking.\n\nHere's a sample API call using Typescript:\n\nAs I mentioned, Claude 3.7 Sonnet is included in the free tier account on claude.ai but without the extended thinking mode. You can also choose to upgrade your account to either the Pro ($20 per month) or Team ($30 per month).\n\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet keeps the same pricing as previous models:\n\nThis pricing includes thinking tokens when using the extended thinking mode. For API users, there are options for cost savings:\n\nFor me as a developer, having a more powerful AI model means I can have more confidence that it'll have better awareness of my project's code base and is more capable of generating more secure and more complete code.\n\nThe ability to understand context across an entire codebase is particularly valuable. Previous models often lost track of how different parts of a project fit together, but Claude 3.7 Sonnet seems to maintain a more cohesive understanding of large projects.\n\nFor researchers, the deep thinking capability of this model means there's less chance of hallucinations, and it actually generates more meaningful and factual answers. The visible reasoning process also helps researchers understand how the model reached its conclusions, which is important for trust and verification.\n\nFor casual users, the responses from this new model are actually more reliable and less robotic. The longer context window and improved reasoning lead to conversations that feel more natural and helpful.\n\nFor AI developers, claude-3.7-sonnet and claude-3.7–sonnet-thinking are now supported in Cursor!\n\nHere's how you can switch to the new models in Cursor.\n\nI plan to do some testing and build sample apps to see how well the new Claude models handle app generation on Cursor. This will give me a better sense of their real-world capabilities beyond the benchmarks.\n\nI was surprised to see Anthropic drop Claude 3.7 Sonnet out of the blue (or maybe I wasn't paying so much attention on the leaks). I was actually expecting Claude 3.5 Opus to be released first but it seems that they have scrapped that model already.\n\nNow, it's clear that big tech companies are racing to release the best AI model with reasoning capabilities. It's only been weeks since DeepSeek released R-1, then xAI launched Grok 3 with reasoning capabilities, and now we got Claude 3.7 Sonnet. It's honestly a bit overwhelming and I don't even know if the benchmarks from these tech companies are actually reliable.\n\nWhat I am most excited about is the integration of Claude 3.7 Sonnet in coding tools like Cursor. I can't wait to test it out by building more complex applications, and also learn more about the Claude Code which is also very interesting.\n\nFor developers especially, the improvements in coding abilities and the introduction of Claude Code could change how we work. Having an AI that can understand large codebases and handle substantial engineering tasks could free us to focus on more creative aspects of development.\n\nWhile I'm cautious about some of the claims being made, Claude 3.7 Sonnet does point to a future where AI works alongside humans as a true thinking partner rather than just a fancy autocomplete tool. I'll be testing it extensively to see if it lives up to the hype.\n\n---------------------------\n\nStay Updated:- Follow Build Fast with AI pages for all the latest AI updates and resources.\n\nExperts predict 2025 will be the defining year for Gen AI Implementation.

    "content": "## Resources and Community\n\n### Resources Section\n\nThe best time to start with AI was yesterday. The second best time? Right after reading this post.\n\nJoin Build Fast with AI’s Gen AI Launch Pad 2025—a 6-week transformation program designed to accelerate your AI mastery and empower you to build revolutionary applications.\n\n1- What is a transformer?\n\nThe Transformer model has revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) with its innovative design, built around three core components: Self-Attention, Positional Encoding, and Feed-Forward Neural Networks. These groundbreaking ideas were first introduced in 2017 in the now-famous paper “Attention is All You Need” by Vaswani et al. Since then, Transformers have become a cornerstone of deep learning, powering tasks like machine translation, text generation, sentiment analysis, and more. Their versatility and efficiency continue to shape the future of AI.\n\n2 — How does the transformer work?\n\nTransformers are made up of two main components: an encoder and a decoder, both of which utilize self-attention mechanisms and feed-forward neural networks. Imagine translating the English sentence \"I love flowers\" into Vietnamese. The encoder takes in the English sentence, processes it, and passes the information to the decoder, which generates the output: \"Tôi yêu thích những bông hoa.\" Every layer within the encoder and decoder is equipped with self-attention mechanisms and feed-forward neural networks to carry out this process effectively.\n\nInput Embedding:\n\nThe first stage involves processing English sentences as input data. Unlike word-for-word translation, converting English to Vietnamese isn’t straightforward due to differences in grammar, word order, and word count. This is where Tokenization and Embedding come into play.\n\nTokenization breaks the text into smaller units called tokens, which can be either words or subwords, depending on the specific use case. Embedding, on the other hand, transforms each token into a dense vector representation using an embedding layer.\n\nThink of embeddings as a “vector world” where similar words cluster closely together, reflecting their related meanings. Meanwhile, words with different meanings are positioned far apart. While embeddings may seem complex at first, they provide a powerful way to capture relationships between words.\n\nPositional Encoding:\n\nPositional encoding plays a critical role in the transformer architecture by embedding information about a token’s position within a sequence. Without it, the model could lose vital context, leading to potential misunderstandings. Positional encoding works by adding a unique positional vector to each token’s embedding, allowing the model to understand both the meaning of the token and its position within the sequence.\n\nFor example, consider the sentence, “I love the movie so bad.” Without positional encoding, the model might misinterpret the context, associating “bad” with negativity and “love” with positivity, treating them separately. This could result in a jumbled output like, “So I love the bad movie.” Positional encoding ensures that the sequence’s structure and meaning remain intact, making it indispensable in the transformer architecture.\n\nEncoder:\n\nThe encoder, shown on the left in Figure 1, is designed to process and comprehend the input sentence. Its primary goal is to create a meaningful representation of the input while capturing the relationships between its elements. This processed information is then passed to the decoder to generate the output.\n\nThe encoder consists of multiple identical layers, and each layer is made up of two key sub-layers: the Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanism and the Feed-Forward Neural Network. These sub-layers are applied sequentially within each encoder layer, ensuring an effective transformation of the input data into a form the decoder can utilize.\n\nSelf-attention operates by calculating the relationships between elements in a sequence through the Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) matrices. The process begins by multiplying these matrices and applying a softmax function to generate attention weights. These weights determine the importance of each element relative to the others. Finally, the attention weights are used to compute a weighted sum of the value vectors, producing the output of the self-attention mechanism.\n\nA straightforward example makes the concept of self-attention easier to grasp. Consider the sentence: “I love the fat cats; they will never mess up my house because they never want to run.” Here, the word “they” refers to “cats.” Self-attention enables the model to make this connection, linking “they” back to its proper context—the subject of the previous clause, “cats.”\n\nFor a computer, identifying such relationships isn’t a simple task. Self-attention provides the mechanism to capture and understand these dependencies, even across different parts of the sentence, ensuring the correct interpretation of the text.\n\nMulti-Head Attention is essentially a collection of self-attention mechanisms working in parallel. Think of it as having multiple perspectives on the same text, where each \"head\" focuses on a specific detail. For instance, one head might track who is performing an action, another might identify what the action is, and yet another might consider the context of when or where it happens.\n\nThis is similar to applying different filters in a neural network layer to capture various aspects of an image. In Multi-Head Attention, the input information is divided among the heads, allowing each to process a smaller portion of the data. This approach makes handling large datasets more efficient. Once all heads complete their tasks, their outputs are combined and transformed into a unified representation. This transformation ensures the output is in a format that the next stage of the neural network can effectively use.\n\nThe next step is the Feed-Forward Neural Network, applied to the output of the self-attention mechanism. This network consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation function in between. The combination of these layers enables the model to learn and represent complex patterns and relationships within the data, enhancing its ability to process and understand intricate structures in the input.\n\nDecoder\n\nThe decoder, shown on the right in Figure 1, is responsible for generating the output text sequence (in this case, the Vietnamese sentence). It combines Masked Multi-Attention, Multi-Head Attention, and Feed-Forward components. While we've already discussed Multi-Head Attention and Feed-Forward, these components in the decoder function similarly to those in the encoder. However, their role in the decoder is to interpret the information passed from the encoder, align the input and output sequences, and generate accurate translations or responses.\n\nFor the example above, once the encoder has processed the English sentence, the decoder's task is to generate the corresponding Vietnamese sentence based on the encoded information.\n\nMasked Multi-Head Attention allows the decoder to focus on different parts of the sequence, but with the added constraint of masking. This masking is the key difference in how attention scores are calculated in the decoder’s first multi-headed attention layer. The purpose of masking is to prevent the model from seeing future words in the sequence, ensuring it only attends to the words that have already been processed.\n\nFor example, in the sentence “Once upon a time, there was a…”, when processing the word “time”, the model can only \"see\" the part of the sentence up to “Once upon a time”. It cannot access the upcoming words, like “there was a”, and instead focuses solely on the word “time”. This ensures the model generates text one word at a time, building upon what’s already been written.\n\nWithout masking, the model would have access to the entire sentence at once, leading to inaccurate predictions, poor generalization, and issues with word order. Masking ensures that the decoder’s predictions are grounded in the context of previously generated words, maintaining the logical flow of the output.\n\nSummary\n\nThe Transformer architecture has proven to be incredibly valuable for Natural Language Processing (NLP). By combining self-attention mechanisms, Positional Encoding, and Feed-Forward neural networks, Transformers provide a powerful framework for a wide range of tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, sentiment analysis, question answering, and more.\n\nThis architecture has significantly advanced the capabilities of NLP models, elevating them to new levels of performance. As a result, Transformers are now fundamental tools in developing diverse applications that rely on understanding and generating human language. Their flexibility and efficiency continue to push the boundaries of what’s possible in the field of NLP.\n\n---------------------------\n\nStay Updated:- Follow Build Fast with AI pages for all the latest AI updates and resources.\n\nExperts predict 2025 will be the defining year for Gen AI implementation.Want to be ahead of the curve?\n\nJoin Build Fast with AI’s Gen AI Launch Pad 2025 - your accelerated path to mastering AI tools and building revolutionary applications.\n\n---------------------------\n\nJoin our community of 12,000+ AI enthusiasts and learn to build powerful AI applications!

Known for its strong reasoning abilities and cost-effective training, the model has drawn global interest. However, our security analysis highlights significant safety concerns.\n\nBy employing algorithmic jailbreaking techniques, our team conducted an automated attack on DeepSeek R1 using 50 randomly selected prompts from the HarmBench dataset. These prompts spanned six categories of harmful content, including cybercrime, misinformation, and illicit activities.\n\nThe findings were concerning: DeepSeek R1 failed to block a single harmful prompt, recording a 100% attack success rate. In contrast, competing models demonstrated at least some level of resistance.\n\nOur analysis indicates that DeepSeek’s cost-efficient training strategies—such as reinforcement learning, chain-of-thought self-evaluation, and distillation—may have weakened its safety measures. Compared to other leading reasoning models, DeepSeek R1 appears to lack effective safeguards, making it highly vulnerable to algorithmic jailbreaking and potential misuse.\n\nA follow-up report will further explore advancements in jailbreaking techniques for reasoning models. This research highlights the critical need for thorough security assessments in AI development, ensuring that improvements in efficiency and reasoning do not compromise safety. It also reinforces the importance of integrating third-party security measures to maintain consistent and reliable protections in AI applications.\n\nIn recent days, DeepSeek R1—a cutting-edge reasoning model from Chinese AI startup DeepSeek—has dominated headlines. Its remarkable performance on benchmark tests has drawn widespread attention, not just from the AI community but from the global tech landscape.\n\nWhile much of the discussion has focused on DeepSeek R1’s capabilities and potential impact on AI innovation, there has been little examination of its security risks. To bridge this gap, we conducted an in-depth security assessment using a methodology similar to our AI Defense algorithmic vulnerability testing. Our goal was to evaluate the model’s safety mechanisms and overall resilience.\n\nIn this blog, we’ll address three key questions: What makes DeepSeek R1 a significant model? Why is it crucial to analyze its vulnerabilities? And how does its security compare to other leading reasoning models?\n\nBuilding and training state-of-the-art AI models typically demands vast computational power and costs reaching hundreds of millions of dollars. Despite ongoing advancements in efficiency, developing high-performing models remains an expensive endeavor. However, DeepSeek has emerged as a disruptor, claiming to achieve results comparable to leading AI systems while using only a fraction of the resources.\n\nDeepSeek’s recent models—DeepSeek R1-Zero (trained entirely with reinforcement learning) and DeepSeek R1 (an enhanced version refined with supervised learning)—prioritize advanced reasoning capabilities. Their research suggests performance levels on par with OpenAI’s o1 model while surpassing Claude 3.5 Sonnet and ChatGPT-4o in areas like mathematics, coding, and scientific problem-solving. Most notably, DeepSeek R1 was reportedly trained for just $6 million, a fraction of the billions spent by AI giants like OpenAI.\n\nDeepSeek models are built on three core principles that set them apart:\n\n1️⃣ Chain-of-Thought Processing – Enables the model to self-evaluate its reasoning step by step.\n\n2️⃣ Reinforcement Learning – Guides the model to improve its responses by rewarding logical accuracy.\n\n3️⃣ Distillation – Allows large models (e.g., 671 billion parameters) to train smaller, more efficient versions (1.5B–70B parameters) for broader accessibility.\n\nChain-of-thought prompting helps break down complex problems into manageable steps—similar to how students show their work when solving equations. This process is paired with \"scratch-padding,\" where the model performs intermediate calculations separately from the final answer. If it detects an error, it can retrace its steps and attempt a different approach.\n\nMeanwhile, reinforcement learning rewards models for generating not just correct final answers but also accurate intermediate steps. This significantly improves performance in logic-heavy tasks that require deep reasoning.\n\nLastly, distillation ensures that smaller models inherit key abilities from larger ones. A powerful “teacher” model trains a smaller “student” model, allowing it to replicate advanced reasoning skills while operating more efficiently.\n\nBy integrating chain-of-thought reasoning, reinforcement learning, and distillation, DeepSeek has developed models that outperform traditional large language models (LLMs) in reasoning tasks while maintaining cost-effective, high-speed performance.\n\nDeepSeek introduces a new paradigm in AI model development. Since the launch of OpenAI’s o1 model, AI research has increasingly prioritized reasoning capabilities, allowing large language models (LLMs) to adapt dynamically through continuous user interaction. Unlike traditional approaches that rely heavily on expensive human-labeled datasets and massive computational resources, DeepSeek R1 achieves high-level reasoning performance with a more cost-effective training strategy.\n\nThere’s no doubt that DeepSeek’s innovations have made a significant impact on the AI landscape. However, performance alone isn’t enough—we must also evaluate whether this novel approach comes with compromises in safety and security. Understanding DeepSeek R1’s potential vulnerabilities is essential to ensuring that advancements in reasoning capabilities do not introduce risks that could lead to exploitation or misuse.\n\nTo assess DeepSeek R1’s safety, we conducted security and vulnerability testing across several leading AI models, including OpenAI’s O1-preview and other high-performing reasoning models.\n\nOur evaluation involved an automated jailbreaking algorithm applied to 50 randomly selected prompts from the widely used HarmBench benchmark. HarmBench consists of 400 behaviors spanning seven categories of harmful content, including:\n\nWe measured model safety using Attack Success Rate (ASR)—the percentage of behaviors for which jailbreaks were successful. ASR is a standard metric in AI security evaluations and provides insight into a model’s resistance to manipulation.\n\nTo ensure fairness and reproducibility, we sampled all models at temperature 0, the most deterministic setting. This allows for consistent results and ensures our jailbreak attempts were not influenced by randomness.\n\nAdditionally, our approach combined automated refusal detection with human oversight to validate jailbreak attempts, ensuring a reliable assessment of DeepSeek R1’s safety against other frontier models.\n\nDeepSeek R1 has been praised for achieving high performance with a fraction of the budget that other AI leaders invest in developing their models. However, our findings suggest that this cost-efficiency may come at the expense of safety and security.\n\nOur security assessment revealed a 100% Attack Success Rate (ASR) for DeepSeek R1—meaning it failed to block a single harmful prompt from the HarmBench dataset. In stark contrast, other frontier models, like OpenAI’s o1, demonstrated stronger resistance, successfully preventing the majority of adversarial jailbreak attempts through built-in security guardrails.\n\nThe chart below presents a comparison of attack success rates across different models, highlighting DeepSeek R1’s lack of effective safety mechanisms.\n\nThe table below gives better insight into how each model responded to prompts across various harm categories.\n\nThis analysis was conducted by the advanced AI research team at Robust Intelligence (now part of Cisco) in collaboration with researchers from the University of Pennsylvania. Notably, the entire assessment cost less than $50, leveraging a fully algorithmic validation methodology—the same approach used in our AI Defense product.\n\nThis method was applied to a reasoning model surpassing previous benchmarks, including our Tree of Attack with Pruning (TAP) research from last year. In an upcoming post, we will dive deeper into this new frontier of algorithmic jailbreaking for reasoning models, exploring its implications for AI security and adversarial robustness.\n\nDeepSeek R1 represents a significant leap in AI reasoning capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a fraction of the resources typically required for large-scale AI models. However, our security analysis highlights a critical concern: DeepSeek R1 completely lacks effective guardrails, making it highly vulnerable to algorithmic jailbreaking.\n\nWith a 100% attack success rate, DeepSeek R1 failed to block a single harmful prompt from the HarmBench dataset, raising serious safety and security concerns. In contrast, other leading AI models, such as OpenAI’s o1, have demonstrated stronger resistance to adversarial attacks through robust security mechanisms.\n\nThese findings underscore the urgent need for rigorous safety evaluations in AI development. As reasoning models become more powerful, companies must balance efficiency with security, ensuring that advancements in AI do not come at the cost of safety. Future research must focus on developing stronger guardrails, third-party oversight, and improved adversarial defenses to prevent misuse and exploitation of AI technologies.\n\nIn our follow-up post, we will explore the evolving landscape of algorithmic jailbreaking in reasoning models, diving deeper into the methodologies that make these attacks possible—and how they can be mitigated.\n\n---------------------------\n\nStay Updated:- Follow Build Fast with AI pages for all the latest AI updates and resources.\n\nExperts predict 2025 will be the defining year for Gen AI Implementation.
