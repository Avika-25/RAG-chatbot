Gen AI Launch Pad 2025 is your chance to shape tomorrow.

As LLM-powered applications become more sophisticated, understanding their internal processes is crucial for debugging, performance optimization, and security. OpenLLMetry (Open Large Language Model Telemetry) provides an observability toolkit tailored for LLM-based applications. It allows developers to track data flow, monitor prompts, collect user feedback, and optimize workflows effortlessly.

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to integrate OpenLLMetry into an LLM application, analyze its key features, and demonstrate its practical use through coding examples.

Before diving into implementation, install the necessary dependencies:

Next, configure API keys for authentication:

This setup ensures secure communication between OpenLLMetry and your LLM application.

Once dependencies are installed, initialize OpenLLMetry within your application:

With this initialization, OpenLLMetry starts collecting traces, which help visualize and analyze LLM request-response cycles.

One of OpenLLMetry’s key features is tracing LLM interactions. Let’s define a function that tracks a simple joke generation request:

Beyond basic tracking, OpenLLMetry supports agent and tool monitoring, useful for autonomous workflows. Let’s create a joke translation agent:

Tracking prompt versions is crucial for evaluating model performance. OpenLLMetry provides prompt observability:

OpenLLMetry is a powerful observability tool for LLM applications, offering:

* track_llm_call monitors the OpenAI API call.
* report_request logs the LLM request.
* report_response captures the model’s response.
* The result is a structured trace, enabling debugging and performance analysis.

* @tool decorates a function that retrieves history-related jokes.
* @agent monitors the joke translation process.
* This enables observability over both tools and agents.

* Helps track changes in prompts over time.
* Evaluates prompt effectiveness.
* Identifies regression issues in model responses.

* LLM Call Tracing – Monitor request-response cycles.
* Prompt Versioning – Track and analyze prompt performance.
* Agent & Tool Monitoring – Gain insights into autonomous system workflows.
* User Feedback Tracking – Collect and act on feedback for model improvement.
