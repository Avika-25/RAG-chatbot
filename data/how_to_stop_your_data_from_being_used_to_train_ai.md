### Steps to Opt-Out of Slack‚Äôs Global Model Training:

Many AI companies have already scraped web content, making it likely that anything you've posted is in their systems. They remain secretive about their data sources, leaving AI training processes largely opaque and difficult to understand.

Users of the career networking website were surprised to learn in September that their data was potentially being used to train AI models. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, people want that edge in their careers, and what our gen-AI services do is help give them that assist,‚Äù says Eleanor Crum, a spokesperson for LinkedIn.

People reveal all sorts of personal information while using a chatbot. OpenAI provides some options for what happens to what you say to ChatGPT ‚Äî including allowing its future AI models not to be trained on the content. ‚ÄúWe give users a number of easily accessible ways to control their data, including self-service tools to access, export, and delete personal information through ChatGPT. That includes easily accessible options to opt out from the use of their content to train models,‚Äù says Taya Christianson, an OpenAI spokesperson. (The options vary slightly depending on your account type, and data from enterprise customers is not used to train models).

OpenAI also says if you have a ‚Äúhigh volume‚Äù of images hosted online that you want removed from training data, then it may be ‚Äúmore efficient‚Äù to add GPTBot to the robots.txt file of the website where the images are hosted.

Traditionally a website‚Äôs robots.txt file ‚Äî a simple text file that usually sits at websitename.com/robots.txt ‚Äî has been used to tell search engines, and others, whether they can include your pages in their results. It can now also be used to tell AI crawlers not to scrape what you have published ‚Äî and AI companies have said they‚Äôll honor this arrangement.

For users of Google‚Äôs chatbot, Gemini, conversations may sometimes be selected for human review to improve the AI model. Opting out is simple, though. Open up Gemini in your browser, click on¬†Activity, and select the¬†Turn Off¬†drop-down menu. Here you can just turn off the Gemini Apps Activity, or you can opt out as well as delete your conversation data. While this does mean in most cases that future chats won‚Äôt be seen for human review, already selected data is not erased through this process. According to¬†Google‚Äôs privacy hub for Gemini, these chats may stick around for three years.

1. Open Gemini in Your Browser:

2. Access the Activity Settings:

3. Locate the Drop-Down Menu:

4. Disable Gemini Apps Activity:

5. Optional - Delete Conversation Data:

6. Understand Limitations:

7. Confirm Changes:

For more information, refer to the privacy section of the Gemini app.

All of those random Slack messages at work might be used by the company to train its models as well. ‚ÄúSlack has used machine learning in its product for many years. This includes platform-level machine-learning models for things like channel and emoji recommendations,‚Äù says Jackie Rocca, a vice president of product at Slack who‚Äôs focused on AI.

Even though the company does not use customer data to train a large language model for its Slack AI product, Slack may use your interactions to improve the software‚Äôs machine-learning capabilities. This could include information like your messages, content, and files, says Slack‚Äôs privacy page.

The only real way to opt out is to have your administrator email Slack at feedback@slack.com. The message must have the subject line ‚ÄúSlack Global model opt-out request‚Äù and include your organization‚Äôs URL. Slack doesn‚Äôt provide a timeline for how long the opt-out process takes, but it should send you a confirmation email after it‚Äôs complete.

1. Contact Your Slack Administrator:

2. Draft an Email to Slack:

3. Set the Subject Line:

4. Include the Organization‚Äôs URL:

5. Send the Email:

6. Wait for Confirmation:

7. Verify Changes:

For more details, refer to Slack‚Äôs privacy policy.
