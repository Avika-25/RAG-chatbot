Gen AI Launch Pad 2025 is where creators belong.

As large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, assessing their performance across diverse datasets and tasks has become increasingly important. PromptBench is a unified library designed to evaluate and understand these models effectively. In this guide, we will explore how to set up and use PromptBench, understand its core functionalities, and learn how to assess model performance efficiently.

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

To begin, install the promptbench library using pip:

Before you can use OpenAI models or other APIs, set up your API key:

Why is this necessary? API keys allow access to LLMs like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google’s PaLM. Ensure you have the right API credentials before proceeding.

PromptBench supports a variety of datasets for benchmarking. To list all available datasets, use:

For example, to load the SST-2 sentiment analysis dataset:

Other available datasets include:

To check the first five entries of the dataset:

To see all available models in PromptBench:

For instance, to load FLAN-T5 Large, use:

Other supported models include:

If using OpenAI’s GPT models, ensure your API key is set:

PromptBench allows multiple prompts for evaluation. Example:

Why is this useful?

Since model predictions are textual, we map outputs to numerical labels:

Expected Output:

Key Takeaways:

PromptBench supports black-box adversarial prompt attacks:

This helps test model robustness against manipulative prompts.

To mitigate test data contamination, we use DyVal:

This ensures generated test samples remain unbiased and fresh.
