Prompt engineering is an essential skill for effectively utilizing large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5 and PaLM. Promptify is a powerful tool that simplifies prompt generation for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, making it easier to extract structured outputs without the need for extensive training data.

In this guide, we’ll walk through how to use Promptify for key NLP tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER), binary classification, sentiment analysis, and topic extraction. You’ll learn how to set up Promptify, understand its key features, and apply it in real-world scenarios with just a few lines of Python code.

To install Promptify, run the following command:

Since Promptify interacts with generative AI models, you’ll need an API key. In Google Colab, retrieve it using:

Alternatively, if you're using a local environment, store your key as an environment variable:

Named Entity Recognition (NER) extracts structured information from unstructured text. Here’s how Promptify makes NER effortless:

The output is a structured JSON-like list of extracted entities:

Binary classification assigns a label (e.g., positive/negative) to input text. Here’s how Promptify enables this task:

Sentiment analysis determines whether text conveys a positive or negative sentiment.

Topic extraction identifies the main subject of a text.

Promptify simplifies NLP tasks like NER, classification, sentiment analysis, and topic extraction with minimal code. By leveraging structured prompts, it ensures accurate and formatted outputs, making it ideal for real-world applications in healthcare, finance, marketing, and more.
