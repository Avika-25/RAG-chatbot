Are you stuck waiting for the right time, or will you make now the right time?

Gen AI Launch Pad 2025 is your answer.

Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing how we automate workflows, interact with digital assistants, and build intelligent systems. OpenAI’s Agents Python library enables developers to create AI agents that can handle complex tasks, collaborate, and interact with external tools effortlessly. In this guide, we’ll explore how to set up and use OpenAI Agents for various automation scenarios.

Before diving into coding, ensure you have Python installed and then install the OpenAI Agents library:

Next, set up your OpenAI API key:

Let’s start with a simple AI agent that generates responses to user queries.

Handoff mechanisms allow agents to delegate tasks efficiently. Below, we define agents that speak different languages and a triage agent that assigns user requests accordingly.

Agents can call external functions for retrieving dynamic data. Here’s an example where an agent fetches weather information:

Streaming enables real-time responses from AI agents. Below, we create an agent that streams joke responses dynamically:

Now, let’s build a customer service AI that handles FAQs and seat bookings for an airline.

OpenAI Agents simplify AI automation by enabling multi-agent collaboration, function calling, and streaming responses. Whether you’re automating workflows, customer support, or chatbot interactions, this library provides a powerful framework for intelligent systems.
